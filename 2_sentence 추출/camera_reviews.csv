Canon EOS Rebel T6 DSLR Camera with 18-55mm IS II Lens Bundle + Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Lens and 500mm Preset Lens + 32GB Memory + Filters + Monopod + Spider Tripod + Professional Bundle,"I love this camera. I've been a longtime fan of canon rebel SLR. I was worried the digital model wouldn't live up to its predecessor. My worries were unfounded. Everything about this camera is wonderful. Easy to figure out (even for an old lady like me). I recommend spending several days with the camera just trying out all the features and functions before using it for an important event, because there are so many enhancements and possibilities. You COULD just put it on auto and get fantastic pictures, but then what would be the point of buying a camera with so many great features? The lenses included in this bundle are all great. The 500mm, I didn't think I'd use, but it's been so fun taking pics of the moon. It takes time to get used to the light balance if you are used to film cameras, so practice with it if that's how you started. If you started on digital cameras, you won't have any problems. The camera bag is too small to hold everything that comes with it, so if you want to take everything with you, get a bigger bag. The bag isn't waterproof, either. Just water resistant. So a good, large, waterproof camera bag is a good additional purchase. You can't go wrong with this bundle. I was so nervous buying something this expensive online, but I'm so happy I bought it.Included a few photos I've taken with it since buying it in June. The moon is with 500mm lens, manual setting w/250 shutter speed (on tripod using the included shutter cord/button). The other pics are in Colorado.","July 23, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Elizabeth Bonecher-Brenaman
Canon EOS Rebel T6 DSLR Camera with 18-55mm IS II Lens Bundle + Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Lens and 500mm Preset Lens + 32GB Memory + Filters + Monopod + Spider Tripod + Professional Bundle,I absolutely love this camera! I was extremely nervous to order something so expensive when it had only a few reviews. It comes with 3 lenses two of which are canon brand lenses and one that isn't but still is very nice. Plus it came with all kinds of fun other things like a mini tripod and an different filter lenses. Great purchase glad I took a chance on this product!,"May 6, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lisa F.

I've been shopping around for this type of camera and lenses for quite some time so I knew what I wanted and the average price. Let me say, it was way more than this. AND here I got lots of accessories that I wouldn't have gotten at a store. I am not a professional photographer, just an amateur that wants to mess with it and learn. I've used a camera like this with my work so I am familiar with it and this one met all my expectations. I have not tried the very large lens yet but the two Cannon lenses work great. I also have not tried the flash that came with it yet. I'm delighted to have a mono-pole but will use a regular tripod, which I already have, when using the longest lens. I do have to say the bag that came with this stuff is a bit cheap feeling. I quickly ditched that and got a backpack to transport everything.","June 7, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,michs

My sincere apologies for I thought I was missing 3 of the included filters. As I looked further in to the case it comes in, I found the 3 missing filters. Aside from that, this camera deal is a total package!! I'm most impressed with the quality of images and every time I use it, I get better as I become more familiar with the manipulation of its settings. I HIGHLY recommend this package!!

Two short lenses and great, the long one is a bit of a gimmick. This is. Super entry pack.

Loved that camera!!! Then I bought an SX40 and loved that camera and last year decided on something stronger - the SX60. For some reason I couldn't get a feeling for that one. Then I saw the T6 w/the 500mm lens.  Almost identical to the XTi - only digital. Bought it on Black Friday, had it Saturday. I couldn't have asked for better packaging with the camera and one lens wrapped with bubble wrap. The 75-300 was in a box of it own and packed so it wouldn't bounce around. The whole bundle was packed very securely. Tried the camera and lenses and all worked as it should. I can see an affair coming already with this camera. If you've ever had one of the 35mm film Rebels, you'll adore this one.","November 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,PrestonPhoto

Although I purchased some extra lenses and accessories to go with this set, I am very pleased with this set as a starter set. Takes great pictures, and is very versatile for someone who wants to take a lot of different types of photos. The lenses are not the best quality, but they are pretty well made and should last for a very long time if not abused.","January 9, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Father
Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"i've taken some amazing pics with this. people are shocked it was with a point and shoot.,I put a couple up for example.","August 21, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kristy
Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),The battery life for this camera was less than 2 hours.  I charged it overnight to be ready for my tours the next day.  After about 20 pictures the battery was at half strength and lasted for maybe another 20 pictures.  The older Sony camera batteries had at least 6-8 hours of constant picture taking.  I even bought extra batteries but they weren't any better.  It was terrible for my trip to Scandinavia.  Good thing I had my Ipad otherwise I wouldn't have had any pictures to share with my friends.  You would think that newer cameras would work better but this camera is proof that statement is incorrect. My big Nikon Camera had batteries that last 6-8 hours without recharging..,"June 1, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Jo Ann Meyer
Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),Totally pleased with purchase!! Comes with three chords that when all put together Can be used to charge in the wall outlet. Then one chord can be used to charge in the computer. And one cord for the car.Super easy to use. To set up the camera is very simple and easy to figure out which button is which.It comes with a battery but no memory card the memory card I had to buy separately but it was not expensive and for the price of the camera I was not expecting it.It takes just your regular general memory card nothing fancy.The only issue I had with it was the arm strap. Even in the instructions it did not say how to attach it and we have yet to figure that out. So if someone could help us that would be great.The feature that helps you to get a focused picture even when you’re shaking a little bit works great.The instructions are pretty much basic and simple and so you may need to find out more information about it online.It works best for outdoor pictures I think. And the zoom is A very nice feature.They have continued to improve it in the past few years.It is lightweight but it has enough body to it to hold it easily when taking a picture.If there is no charge to the battery it takes approximately an hour to an hour and a half to charge.I purchased this camera for the purpose of taking outdoor nature pictures for the cards that I sell. And I am very pleased with the camera and so far think it is going to work great for that purpose. I would recommend this camera to anyone who just want something simple but well worth it with great quality.,"October 10, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Joanna Burns

Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"I have used Sony over the years because of their outstanding quality.  I read reviews before purchasing this one.  I take many, many pictures of mostly small Jewelry items.  I need a CRISP picture w/o graininess and good rich color.  I got neither.  I wish I had ordered my replacement sooner as this has been a big disappointment and I felt as if I maybe got a refurbished camera instead of a brand new one?  For the sake of two days, I am unable to return it.  Please do not buy if you need a camera for fine detailed pictures.  It will not do that for you.","September 8, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,B.

Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),This is probably a good general camera but wasn’t what I looking for. I tried this out at a zoo but since most animals were moving the pictures came out blurry and I couldn’t find a setting to fix this. There is a delay from when you push the button to the picture being taken to the picture showing on the display. The display is pretty low resolution and made me wonder what the quality of the pictures truly were.,"November 12, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sara Amirahmadi
Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"I previously had a Canon S100, which was a good camera for me, but I damaged the racked out lens when it got bumped.  The S100 had worked well for me, but now is not available as new. I read the reviews of other cameras, and thought this Sony camera might be a good camera to use for shooting stills and video at concerts where the venue does not allow larger ""professional"" cameras.  I was very disappointed  in the auto focus function of this camera. It even has an auto-tracking selection where you are supposed to be able to pick a point in the frame to follow focus, but this was still not helpful in stills shooting, and did not seem to be an option for tracking focus in video shooting. I think my cell phone was a better choice for this purpose, but I had wanted a better optical zoom. This camera, despite the 5X zoom, still was not powerful enough to really get me the close ups I was looking for. I also has trouble with slow shutter speeds in a concert I took pix of, making horribly unusable photos. The menu also was not very intuitive.  Because of the focusing and slow shutter speed and menu issues, I promptly returned this for a refund, and received the refund quickly from Amazon.","August 23, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Digster
Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),Gave this to my granddaughter for her 9th birthday.

Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),"Hey the camera does have a slow exposure because of the small sensor. That did not bother me since it takes great photos. I know some people complain of the slow shutter. This is not a camera I would be taking to a sporting event or concert or birthday party. This camera is perfect for sightseeing and landscapes.,As I have other more expensive cameras for that type of photography.  I just wanted something compact to take on airplane when traveling and when I was traveling light. To take nice pictures. You know sometimes you are traveling and do not have time to carry around a dedicated camcorder and a hybrid point and shoot and a dslr. Sometimes you just want to enjoy the vacation and leave your fancy camera at home. That's where the dsc800 comes in handy. I will be updating this review with pictures. In the coming days.","March 30, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jim
Sony (DSCW800) 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver),The first thing I notice is how light the camera is; it seems to be made out of 80%+ plastic. Easy to use. Small and will fit in a pants pocket.

Canon PowerShot SX530 HS Digital Camera with 50x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3-Inch LCD HD 1080p Video (Black)+ Extra Battery + 24GB Class 10 Card Complete Deluxe Accessory Bundle And Much More,"After reading the reviews I was skeptical about the zoom/focus.  After using the camera on a family outing...sure enough when I zoomed in on a subject..it was difficult to maintain a steady hand...and it appeared that my ""close ups"" were not going to be so good.  To my surprise, when I went to transfer the pictures to a folder..ALL the close ups were in focus and crystal clear. (Just make sure the shutter speed is set faster)  Every thing was delivered on time...seems to be a great ""Beginners"" camera for those who wish to be a little better than the average ""Family Photographer"".","May 13, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,tribefan53

It captures a lot, it comes out pretty good, and you can add-on features to it like a microphone. I do recommend the microphone as it’s better for sound quality.","January 23, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Chandra Koy
Nikon COOLPIX B500 16MP 40x Optical Zoom Digital Camera w/Built-in Wi-Fi NFC & Bluetooth (Black) + 16GB SDHC Accessory Bundle,"This was an amazing deal from Beach Camera!  Love the features of this Nikon Coolpix B500.  I'm not a camera person but I love to take pix, and this works very well.  It's like a step above a point-and-click, but with a wonderful lens that can zoom in tight.  I bought this for my husband's birthday because he liked my other one so much that I figured he should have his own.  (not that I don't mind sharing, but when we're together and trying to take pix, seems to me that we should not have to wait our turn to use this great camera),I was particularly impressed with the whole bundle from this seller.  There are so many great accessories included that aren't normally with a camera purchase.  The bag is a really good camera bag that adjusts to hold virtually anything you'd need.  Love that they included both a large spider tripod and a short tripod.  Plus, they sent a 64gb memory card which was a very nice touch.  The cleaning kit was included as was a USB reader for the memory card.  Also, despite the fact that this base camera comes with four batteries, they also included four rechargeable batteries together with a charger.  I think we got a great deal on this camera, and my husband is loving his new toy!","November 7, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Female military veteran
Nikon COOLPIX B500 16MP 40x Optical Zoom Digital Camera w/Built-in Wi-Fi NFC & Bluetooth (Black) + 16GB SDHC Accessory Bundle,"I am a semi pro nature photographer and I found this camera a sore disappointment as it pertains to image quality. I have been using Fuji for about 15 years and I switched to Nikon for a change. It contained most of the basic features as my Fuji except the eye lens. Please note: You are only able to take a picture using the display. If you need to see extreme detail, this may frustrate you. With a 40x zoom, you need an eye lens. I used the camera for about a week and a half. The image quality  is terrible and every image on a regular/auto setting is thoroughly washed out. If you utilize the dawn/dusk or sunset setting it drops a blue cast over the image which in some cases looks ridiculous, but without it, it would be too bright. There is no definition or depth to the images. It seem to me I get either washed out/unremarkable images or blue images. Glare is hard to avoid as well even with a darker setting. You don't see this glare until you download the larger image. I have provided images side by side. From L to R is a cell phone image, one on Auto and one on Dawn/Dusk. At least the cell image has no glare. An everyday user for everyday life, this is fine. Other than that, it has no use. It is my opinion that the reviews posted are fictitious. There is simply no way I could be getting these pictures based on REAL reviews. It doesn't make sense.","March 13, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,Carol A. Corsaro

Nikon COOLPIX B500 16MP 40x Optical Zoom Digital Camera w/Built-in Wi-Fi NFC & Bluetooth (Black) + 16GB SDHC Accessory Bundle,"This is an update to my last review.  This is a great camera for amateur photographers.  It is true to the advertisement.  It is a lot smaller than I expected, but I appreciate that it will be easier to slip into a purse when I travel.  Very comfortable to hold and use.  Straightforward features.  I would say the shutter (if that is the right word) is very slow.  So if you are setting up for a sudden photo op, you might miss it.  That is the reason I cannot give it five stars.  Also, I had a great customer service experience with Beach Camera.  Initially, when I got the camera, there was a defective European battery charger in the box, and for many reasons, it would be no good for a U.S. based customer.  Also, the batteries had already corroded.  It could be argued that someone should have caught it, but I understand mistakes happen.  I appreciate just how quickly they resolved the problem.  Thanks, Beach Camera!","May 25, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jambajan

Very disappointed in this Nikon. Enough so that my next purchase will be another brand altogether. *********This purchase was to replace my NikonCoolpix P510. Had that one for several years and finally the abuse caught up with it. I actually feel like I took a step down with this new camera. But, I have not used it a great deal yet so perhaps my opinion will change. I shot some video at a dog agility trial, even in good sun there was a bit of blur when I zoomed. One negative of note, the usb cable to allow me to upload directly to my pc is RIDICULOUSLY short. Too damn bad the usb cable from my old Nikon won't work with the new one. This camera is OK.

Light weight and small enough to fit in a pocket, easy to use settings (yeah, you can throw that manual away), nice results (though not as good as a smart-phone. probably). Use the auto mode and go ahead and shoot, or choose your own settings. One thing I miss is the copy and edit functions that I had in my other P&S's.

She's having a grand time taking photos. We bought an SD card for 10 bucks to store the photos on; I'm not sure the camera would store them without it. Since it isn't marketed for children with a colorful kid-proof body or built-in games (which I really didn't want), it feels like the grown-up item that it is. It's easy enough to operate without reading the manual although some of the butttons are tiny and hard to see without reading glasses. The pictures are clear.

"HD Mini Digital Cameras,Point and Shoot Digital Cameras for Kids Teenagers Beginners-Travel,Camping,Outdoors,School (Black 2)","I’m a fairly lazy person when it comes to returns, but I’m actually returning this purchase. To be fair to the company, shipping was much faster than expected which was great since I purchased this for my impatient 6 year old. However, quality of the product is FAR below the reviews. The camera is very cheaply made and feels like it’ll break in your hands at any moment. There is a switch on the side of the camera that changes between close up and scenic views that feels like it’s going to break the whole camera every time I use it. The camera never focused for any image (I’m experienced with photography and couldn’t get it to focus) and after fully charging the battery for over 15 hours it died after only 3 pictures. I would strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing this product and go with a better known proven point and shoot. For the time being my 12 year old Olympus point and shoot is still a significantly better option for my son and I’m disappointed that I even gave this a try.","July 22, 2019",1.0 out of 5 stars,MMS

"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","I wanted a small, easy to use camera that could zoom for a trip to Scotland and Ireland.  The camera worked extremely well, though I never went past the 8x optical zoom.  I especially love the option to delay the shutter by 2 seconds in low light to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter button.  Underexposing on stained glass windows (which otherwise looked all white) worked very well.I bought a spare battery and recharger.  I took 1,050 pictures over 22 days, and only replaced the battery twice.  The spent battery recharged in 2 hours.The only problem with the camera is the small cord, which I could not put around my neck.  Consequently, I dropped the camera on stone steps, and it got banged up.  It continued to produce great photos.  I took it to a camera shop, which gave me a long cord to attach to the camera's small cord, so I didn't drop it again.  However, the shop advised me that the tiny connections inside could have come loose, and the camera might not work after a few weeks.  It got me through the trip, and I will now buy another one to replace it.","February 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazoncustomer

"GordVE 2.7 Inch Digital Camera, HD Camera for Backpacking, Mini Digital Camera Pocket Cameras Digital with Zoom, Compact Cameras for Photography","This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.it includes a "";Getting Started""; guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera's maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job it.Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.","February 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Roberta Steiner

"HD Mini Digital Cameras,21MP Point and Shoot Digital Video Cameras-Travel,Camping,Gifts (Black 1)","Smaller is definitely NOT better - especially when it comes to inexpensive electronics.  To begin with, the micro-font instruction manual states that the package includes a digital camera, ProTags Express Software Installation CD, USB cable, User's instruction manual, Strap, Camera bag, Lithium battery, and a charger.  There is no CD nor is there a charger in the kit.  In fact, I called Amazon to send a second camera for the missing parts, and they were not in the second shipment either.  Second, it is nearly impossible to configure the camera with optimum settings.  I am not unfamiliar with cameras and electronics, but I had trouble paging through the settings.  I even had a highly skilled techie friend try to set up the camera and the best we could get out of any of the pictures were grainy shots less than 2 megabytes.

Solid build also picture and video is excellent. Only 3 things I can see so far that are cons. In the sun and recording or charging it can get pretty hot. But that can be fixed. Battery life isnt that great, especially when recording in 4K. But as long as you charge with at least 2.4A, it recharges quick. And the last thing is you cant charge while recording.

This will put you a step ahead saving money and time of purchase of those necessary articles.

Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 20MP 8X Zoom Digital Camera (Silver) + 32GB Card + Reader + Case + Accessory Bundle,"The camera and the accessories arrived as expected, and after charging the battery (must be taken out of the camera and placed in the charger) I tried to take some pictures in different light situations and different distances. The quality of the pictures are acceptable but not outstanding. I had expected more sharpness from a 20 MP camera, and less noise in the low light pictures. However, this is a low price camera, and is great for snap shots. The small size makes it easy to carry around, and the 32GB memory card can hold several thousand pictures. The memory card must be taken out of the camera and placed in either the USB cradle that is part of the deal or a designated port on your computer.,I give the product 4 stars only because of the picture quality and the lack of charging and transfer possibility without opening the camera to remove battery and/or memory card.","June 10, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jens

Ugh. My immediate thought was to have a camera shipped by Amazon to our first stop. That worked perfectly, but considering what I was willing to spend I had to consider our options carefully. My main objective was to free us from the necessity to use our phones as cameras because I was looking for better battery life, more zoom capability, and ease of download to my laptop. Although this is a very tiny camera, it met those objectives. In fact, the ease of download greatly exceeded expectations with the flash drive transfer process. The camera has everything included, is easy to use, and produces reasonably good photos. I will leave the technical discussion of photo quality to the more avid photographers, but we are pleased. This will be a camera that accompanies us easily when we don't want to drag along the higher end photo gear.","August 27, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rappers Mom

Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 20MP 8X Zoom Digital Camera (Silver) + 32GB Card + Reader + Case + Accessory Bundle,"Well, it worked for a few moments at least.,After turning it on initially, it displayed the captured camera view (as you'd expect) for about 10 seconds. Then, the screen turned pink, and then became a bunch of a black / white / pink scrolling horizontal bars (see attached image). Changing the settings affected the color / zoom of the scrolling bars, but would not restore the camera view.

Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red)," I do professional photography for a living but wanted a small pocket camera for hiking/traveling/walking and quick things around the house without dragging out a bunch of equipment. It fits in a pocket perfectly! I don't know about you but if I take my pro gear out on a walking, I never actually get any exercise, I just stand around taking photos in one or two spots the whole time. Lol. So — my view on this is it's not as good as previous point-n-shoots I've had. They used to be heavier, more sturdy, better made and less expensive. This one is lighter, tad flimsy, pricier than I'm used to (for the low quality) and not as good made. Comes with a rechargeable battery which is nice but I don't love it enough to buy a backup, although it does last a very long time, charged it for the first time after 2 months of use which is about 10mins every 3 days or so. Quality is so-so and many of the basic features and settings I'm used to on most other point-n-shoots are not on this camera or very limited. An amateur can take good shots with it but only if you have the patience on the focusing. It can take a long time for it to focus on what you are trying for. For example, say you are trying to get a butterfly on a flower, it may continuously want to focus on the ground rather than the flower/butterfly area (see photo of what I mean or looks like Amazon isn't allowing all my photos so not sure if you can see it). It does AMAZING macro shots most of the time though, it automatically focuses them (best without flash on) but other shots farther away or if trying to do something quick not as great, so give it time to focus. Not the worse quality shots ever but not best either. A tiny bit muddy/painted look if you zoom into the images at 100% (see photo of 100%). The video (one attached) is decent, actually does better than photo stills. It also does not turn off ALL sounds. The settings allow you to turn off many sounds but it keeps the shutter sound, beeps when focusing and there is no way to turn it off. Personally, I don't like the sounds. If I had to choose a pocket camera for hiking and traveling again, I would save a little more and not get this one. If I only wanted to take quick macros inside for products etc, this is the camera to have. I've attached 19 photos and 1 video straight from this camera without Ps edits. ~Happy Shooting~","June 12, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,C. H. Greene

In addition, my husband loves to snorkel, so we wanted a camera that was dual purpose.  He even went so far as to dunk it in a large cup of water at dinner to test the waterproof claim, and it started right up with no issues.  This little camera takes fantastic, crisp pictures!

Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red)," Okay. I gave it 5 stars because I love the camera itself and don't feel I should downgrade my review because of what the listing says. Also it wouldn't let me put in four and a half. But any buyer should know that the listing says that it comes with ""64"" of something regarding memory. It doesn't say 64 of what. Could be Kbites, could be Mbites, could be Gbites, could be raw fish or tooth faerie droppings. Who knows? Turns out there is ZERO. ZIP. NADA. So if you order one of these be sure to buy some memory because it is not included and the camera would be useless without it. Good thing I'm a bit of a memory hog and bought an ""extra"" or I wouldn't have been able to use it at all until I ordered some.,Another small thing that it won't do (and I hold Canon blameless for this) is that there is no way that I can find to put a live view from the camera onto my computer screen—as you would do with a web cam. I didn't buy it specifically to do this kind of thing so I'm not let down but I do a bit of astrophotography and that kind of thing is nice. The screen is too small to tell if there is dirt on one of your lenses in the dark. It ruins the shot if you don't notice it and when you are trying to shoot a picture of the full moon and don't catch it you have to wait at least a month to set the shot up again.,With those two things in mind it's a pretty good camera and I'm happy I got it. The screen is easy to read. It's got a lot of the features that you would expect to find on a more professional grade camera. The menus are fairly intuitive once you've spent fifteen minutes or so with the manual. I should be noted that you do have to download the manual itself because it only comes with a quick start guide. In Auto mode while shooting some pictures, like the moon for example, the exposure is a bit too high but I suspect there is a setting that would fix that, which I haven't found yet. In Program mode it's easy enough to correct that kind of problem, as it is pretty easy to take control of most of the other settings.,I shot the attached video of the moon through my telescope because a picture is worth a thousand more words.,I'm still experimenting with it because I just got it yesterday but I'll update this if I think of anything else.","August 6, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Brett Ashton
Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.,Canon includes a ""Getting Started"" guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.,With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera's maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.,Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job Canon.,Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.","February 24, 2016",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin Breeze
Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I wanted a small, easy to use camera that could zoom for a trip to Scotland and Ireland.  The camera worked extremely well, though I never went past the 8x optical zoom.  I especially love the option to delay the shutter by 2 seconds in low light to prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter button.  Underexposing on stained glass windows (which otherwise looked all white) worked very well.,I bought a spare battery and recharger.  I took 1,050 pictures over 22 days, and only replaced the battery twice.  The spent battery recharged in 2 hours.,The only problem with the camera is the small cord, which I could not put around my neck.  Consequently, I dropped the camera on stone steps, and it got banged up.  It continued to produce great photos.  I took it to a camera shop, which gave me a long cord to attach to the camera's small cord, so I didn't drop it again.  However, the shop advised me that the tiny connections inside could have come loose, and the camera might not work after a few weeks.  It got me through the trip, and I will now buy another one to replace it.","September 28, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sacramento reader

Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"We take a lot of vacations and many photos for family albums.  Our two previous purchases were of Nikon Coolpix.  These inexpensive cameras tend to last just 2-3 years (which is fine, given how affordable they are).  When our Nikon died on us, we decided this time to upgrade and purchase the Canon because Canon has a good reputation.  But we are severely disappointed.  For one, the only flash control this camera has is automatic.  This means that if the camera detects light it will not use the flash, and you have no way of manually using the flash to override the automatic sensor.  Let us say you are taking a photo of someone and there is light in the background.  The camera will detect the light and not use the flash.  But you would want to manually have the flash go off so as to light up the face of the person.  The Nikon Cookpics were MUCH less expensive than this Canon yet did have the manual flash control.  Second, the picture quality is poor - surprising, it is of less quality than the cheaper Nikon.  And finally, we realize that these are cheap cameras but nonetheless, this Canon feels flimsy and ""plasticky"" compared to the Nikon.  You may as well buy the Nikon - you will be spending less money and have more quality.","September 17, 2018",1.0 out of 5 stars,William
Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"At this price point, I wasn't expecting much.  But we were about to go on a cruise and I wanted a point and shoot that I could take on all our excursions (I have heard too many horror stories of phones dropped in the drink).  I was replacing a more expensive camera.  Quite honestly, the photos from this little camera are even better than my old camera - Clear, beautiful color, and excellent definition.  The camera is easy to understand and use.  I am impressed.","July 9, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Book Ninja
Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"This is a wonderful camera. If you’ve ever owned an ELPH camera, you know that they’re high-quality, ultra-portable cameras. Obviously you’re not going to get DSLR-quality images from a camera like this, but this is still a great camera, and if you use a tripod, you will be able to get excellent results. I use mine with an Amazon Basics tripod (which costs a little more than $20 and is really light and portable). Shooting with a tripod, even when using a little Point and Shoot camera, makes all the difference. But back to the camera. This is a great camera. It's also very affordable.","May 20, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nicholas
Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"It's the perfect pocket camera.  Very easy to use, small, light weight.  I love the control button on the back side that allows me to quickly choose portrait shot or automatic ones.  The rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  The resolution is excellent.  The 8X zoom is just right.  I also own 2 Nikon Coolpix pocket cameras which worked very well, but over time no longer hold a battery charge.  Then I recently purchased a cheap Chinese GordeVE pocket camera which I did not care for at all due to poor resolution, etc.  I also own 2 Nikon SLRs which are superior cameras, but I don't always want to lug them around.","June 23, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Donald Ferencz

Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 Digital Camera w/Image Stabilization and Smart AUTO Mode (Red),"I'm taking this abroad with me and it's perfectly sized for pockets, purses and backpacks.

It's quite user-friendly and comes with a full instruction manual, battery+plug-in wall charger and wrist strap. Easy and simple to navigate.

Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I came to Amazon looking for a camera to take on vacations and trips. I only ever use my iPhone for pictures, and wanted to invest in something slightly more professional that wouldn't break the bank. I am in no way a photographer, but this camera sure makes me feel like one. It's the perfect size for travelers, as it fits in your hand perfectly, as it's very small and portable. I think the picture quality is absolutely stunning. I can zoom into a tree from over 100 feet away and it looks as if I'm right in front of it! I haven't taken this camera on my trip to Europe yet, but will update and post the pictures I take once I do. I've mostly just played around with it, taking pictures of my dog or sister. I included a selfie to show the flash - that was taken in a pitch black room. I wasn't even sure it would come out clear, but wow! Look at the quality!,One thing I would like to address is the wifi, which might be my favorite thing about this camera as a whole. I contemplated buying the Canon powershot SX410, which is a cheaper, slightly older version of this camera, but opted for this because of the wifi feature. I can't boast about it enough. I can take a picture of something, click on the wifi option on the camera, connect to the wifi from my phone, open the free camera app and send the picture directly from my camera to my iPhone. I can also delete that picture from the camera once I've saved it to my phone, so I'll never run out of space! The battery life is also very impressive and it seems to stay charged for a long time (another reason it's great for travelers). And the time it takes to fully charge the battery isn't long at all.,I'm just a person who wanted a cool camera to take nice quality pictures. I'm not a photographer or anything near, but I love clean, crisp quality shots. If you want a small, portable camera that takes AMAZING quality pictures, has a KILLER zoom and flash, and has a wifi feature that allows you to share your pictures on social media in the matter of seconds after taking the picture, this is for you. This camera should be so much more expensive that it is because it's absolutely amazing. 10/10 recommend!","August 2, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Martha A. Jungenberg
Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"I don't have a lot of photography or non-phone camera experience. So, I really just jumped into the DSLR world with this camera. Having this for a week, I really enjoy it for how much it can do.,Seems like a lot of the reviews here are people that don't understand how cameras work (ISO, aperture, shutter speed). You DO NOT have full control over aperture or shutter speed. It's an entry level camera. If you want full control, buy a Rebel T5! The specs are not professional either (they're mid-range at best), so don't expect your quality of pics to be super awesome starting out, you need practice. This camera is a tool, you have to control it. It's not going to take great pics by itself!,Here's a few of my favorite pics I've taken in the past week. Enjoy! :)","August 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,J
Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"When I first received this camera, I wrote a  review saying I loved it. The photos were super sharp, and the zoom was amazing. It's so easy to use. However, now, a few months after I received it, it suddenly broke. One day, I used it and everything was fine; the next day, for some reason, the zoom lens wouldn't retract and a message popped up telling me to ""restart the camera."" I had not dropped the camera. I kept it in the camera bag, and had no reason to think it had suffered any trauma. I tried multiple times to restart the camera, but it didn't help. I called Canon, and they suggested I send it to them. Instead, I found an authorized Canon dealership nearby. They saw the camera was still under warranty, and took it in for me to send it themselves to Canon. Today, I was informed that Canon will charge me $93.20 to repair the camera because, they say, the lens is not under warranty. The camera store told me that the lens is the most vulnerable part of the camera. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.","July 31, 2017",2.0 out of 5 stars,Grandma Susie
Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"The canon power shot sx420 is a neat little “point and shoot” camera. Great focal length (see chameleon and fork pictures) good zoom that stays clear and doesn’t get grainy. This was a gift for some one who thought they might like to get into photography but doesn’t understand terms like iso.,I think this will be a good camera for a beginner as it allows you to change picture resolution, light and focus while looking, but has a feature where it tells you the photos info so you can understand.,Usually a Nikon fan but same price range you can’t get wifi enabled- this has WiFi - and it works well! You need to dig a bit to find the camera functions and not everything is as intuitive as I’d like, but I would say overall very good.,Compact size makes a big difference for this camera. It’s very light and handles well.,Night mode is fairly good- husky photo was low light. You need to figure out the settings with in the mode- but it’s doable.,I took away one star because with everything it DOES do, you should be able to do more outside of the “auto” mode.

Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"At first I was thrilled with this camera because the wi-fi features worked right out of the box.,This impressed me. I was quick to review and give it a high rating. I was too quick.,Week after week I started to notice that the shutter speed was too darn slow.,If a subject moves or twitches even the slightest bit, there is a blur.,Canon support, to their credit, is quick to respond, but the suggestions they offer do not work.,There is no setting that seems to impact the shutter speed (even the ISO setting.) It seems the shutter opens for almost a half to 3/4 of a second.,The only pictures that come out decent are ones taken indoors with the flash.,But using bright, available light or exterior bright light yields way too much motion blur.,I bought this camera to show my daughter how a real camera compared to her phone camera.,I lost that argument. Despite the high megapixel feature and big lens... the pictures are really poor. Grainy and blurry.,They other problem is the camera can't focus when fully zoomed in. Maddening.

Canon PowerShot SX420 Digital Camera w/ 42x Optical Zoom - Wi-Fi & NFC Enabled (Black),"First I bought a Coolpix which had wifi. I never could get the wifi to transfer pics to my iPad and the camera was too small and the controls too close to each other to operate the camera. After I found the Coolpix a new home, I bought this Powershot SX420.,First, the camera is large enough to hold still and to operate the controls. I have arthritis, my hands are a little stiff but I can use this camera without any problem. The thumb rest beside the movie button didn't stop my thumb from sliding, so I put a small square of sticky back Velcro there to use for a thumb grip. Problem solved.,The wifi is very easy set up. Pictures transfer painlessly to my pad or the photo printer.,The long zoom makes the SX420 a great kayaking camera. Pictures of wildlife along the shoreline are very clear.,This is a great little camera to have fun with when you're tired of your big camera that seems to take itself so seriously.","August 10, 2017",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheri W

Video Camera Camcorder FamBrow Digital YouTube Vlogging Camera Recorder Full HD 1080P 24MP 3.0 Inch 270 Degree Rotation LCD 16X Digital Zoom Camcorder with 2 Batteries,"I love this camera! The visual and audio quality is surprisingly good. Seems like a really nice camera. Nice compact size. Very well made. Great price. Like most people on the planet now, I use my phone for everything. Communication, internet, games, and as a camera. My phone can pretty much do anything, but there are still times where the phone just won't cut it. Sometimes, you just need a real camera and you need something more robust, something dedicated to pictures and video. My wife and I are traveling overseas next month and we wanted something to properly document our time. The FamBrow Camcorder will be perfect. The camera itself is nice and small. It fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. The hand strap helps to keep things secure. There are not a lot of buttons to worry about with this camera either. It's nice! Everything is comfortable and logically placed. You can leave the camera on standby mode and activate it by opening the viewscreen (which is adjustable). It takes about 10 seconds to go from standby to recordable, so please keep that in mind. The camera can go up to 24 Megapixels, so the camera is very sharp, and it can film in full 1080p. The mic is as good as can be expected, so in close quarters, the sound is great. The camera comes with all of the expected cords. One cord allows you to connect to a TV so you can play your videos directly onto the TV. The other is a USB cable. You can connect it to any USB connection. Both connection ports are clearly labeled for clarity. It may seem strange to a whole generation to use a camera that isn't part of your phone, but for some of us in the older generations, a separate camera is a good idea. I like having a dedicated camera, and the FamBrow Camcorder is great for this. It's small and portable, but strong and powerful. It will take great pictures and high quality video easily. It stores easily and works well. If you are looking for a good camcorder that will give you high quality video, this one is definitely recommended.","May 28, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,levon sargsyan

The picture and sound quality are vastly inferior to that of an average smart phone, even though it boasts 24 megapixels. The videos are grainy, shakey, and the zoom feature is so jumpy it would be embarrassing to use this feature even in an amateur production. The reviews are deceptive, as many are reviewing the 4k models, which, while the quality I'm sure is better, are vastly more expensive. So, you get what you pay for. Why 3 very different cameras are all listed together under one Amazon page is baffling. By all means, if you want all of your videos to look like they were filmed by a 5 year old hopped up on sugar, buy this camera.

I recommend this for an entry level vlogging camera before having to shell out hundreds for a Canon or something along those lines.","May 23, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,A.R.
Digital Camera Video Camera Vlogging YouTube Recorder HD1080P 30FPS 24.0MP 3.0 Inch Flip Screen 16X Digital Zoom WiFi Camera with Wide Angle Lens and 2 Batteries,"There are so many clever functions to this camera. I especially like the “selfie” feature which allows you to see yourself forward facing. The screen flips easily in and out. The lens options are nice as well. I like that it came with a velvet carrying case for the extra lens when not in use. The camera itself is very user friendly, but it’s important to note that you need an SD card before use. Some cameras have some internal memory to store pictures, but this camera does not. So maks sure you purchase a card for this at the same time as buying this camera so they come together.","May 28, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mallory Allen

Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I  got tired of taking photos with my phone , i wanted a real camera , that had a real zoom . I have a number of very expensive  SLR's but they are heavy  to carry around all the time . This is the perfect mix of convenient  and efficient .

Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I have had 4 or 5 Sony digital cameras over the years and they have been great.  When I broke the screen on the last model (totally my fault) I was confident that Sony was the way to go.  A quick google search listed this model as the 2018 best point and shoot under $100 and I was sold.  However, I was deeply disappointed when it arrived.  Honestly I don’t care too much whether a camera has 8MP or 20MP (I rarely enlarge photos).  What I do care about is how long it takes to take the picture.  I hate trying to get a picture and by the time the camera focuses and shoots the subjects (usually kids or animals) have already lost patience.  This camera is way too slow; after every picture there was about a 3-4 second delay when the screen went blank.  Most pictures came out blurry.  Even changing modes didn’t help.  For those who care, this camera felt flimsy, my other Sony was lightweight but had a solid metal casing.  I might have got a lemon but I am guessing Sony got lazy with so few point and shoot cameras being used these days. So I am returning this camera, I haven’t decided on a replacement yet, but this is not worth $80.","May 15, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Katie

Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera (Black),"I am an amateur photographer and own three DSLR cameras with a selection of lenses. However that collection does not eliminate the need for a handy item for just daily needs. I keep this one especially in my car's glove box as a reserve for occasions which require something better than my cell phone camera. For that purpose it meets my expectations and even exceeds it. Yet, this is still a snap shot device with a relatively low price tag and therefore  a DSLR level quality (like background blurring, high shutter speed, high level of low light performance etc.)should not be expected.,Pros:,-Lightweight slim and  stylish design: It can fit in small spaces and look and feel like a high quality item.,-USB charging ability: That is one of the selling points for me. I keep it in my car and I don't want to run out of power any time or go through the hassle of removing the battery and charging it separately ,which requires carrying the charging adapter all the time and also the ability to plug in that adapter. Instead. all I do is to connect it to my 12V car USB charger and it pretty quickly accumulates good amount of charge level... It comes with a wall adapter (5V 0.5A) which connects to a detachable USB cable (so you can use the cable and attach it to any USB charger). But be careful about the USB cable. The standard USB-micro B cable that charges most mobile devices do not work for this type. If you need a replacement or an extra you need to buy a USB-UC E6 cable.,-Easy menu mode: Practicality should be the main focus in a snapshot device and even my grandfather could get through this menu. One of the most user-friendly interfaces I have seen so far.,-Panoramic shoot ability: That was a surprise for me. I had not read the product description in detail before buying and that was such a handy function. I used to take panoramic photos by taking tens of photos with my DSLR and stiching them with a software which was both difficult and time consuming. This function does it instantly and produces comparable quality photos.,-5X optical zoom: When it comes to zooming, in photographic terms, the less is often more. The best lenses even come with no zoom at all. However for a practical item like this, zoom is essential and 5X is a good range for the optical zoom (it is also critical that you compare the optical zoom capacities of devices and not the digital zoom before making a judgement.),-Image quality: As I said above, it does not match the quality of a DSLR and I don't care about the high pixel size either. For cameras with small sensor sizes like snapshots, it is actually better to get a low MP device for sharper images, but this one not bad at all especially in daylight. HD Video quality is also good but again depends on the light...,-Price: the $78 price tag as of august 2014 makes it one of the most affordable snapshot cameras in the market. You can get better deals from time to time but this is quite appealing too.,Cons:,-Low light performance: Again, I want to stress that I am not expecting professional quality from this device, but I found the low light performance moderate at best. The noise was somewhat irritating even with flash.,-Slow shutter speed: It has a continuous shooting mode which is supposed to take multiple frames in a short time as long as the shutter button is depressed. However this device has a long long refractory period between shoots that it is not even worth bothering with that mode. You need to decrease the image quality 3 steps to be able to notice some multiple shooting effect and that is not worth it. So if you wish to take a photo of a flying bird or a running person or a passing by car, you don't have much choice to take multiple photos and decide later.,-Zoom buttons: I like the zoom to be a ring style beneath the shutter button but this is like a plus and minus at the back which is not very convenient.,-No optical viewfinder: This is not a problem for this model only. Most recent cameras sacrifice from an optical viewfinder and all you get is a digital image on the screen to help you adjust your photo before taking it. First of all it does not give the sense of taking a photo but more importantly digital screen viewfinder drains battery and also performs bad in bright light.,-Video focusing sound: While recording video of a closely located object (where there is a constant need to re-adjust autofocusing) and if the surrounding is silent, you can hear the sound of focus adjustments in your recording. But as I said that is only obvious in full silence and for short distance recordings.,Overall you like it or not depends on your expectations. For me it is a handy and adequately performing device with quite useful features. I am happy with this purchase","August 28, 2014",5.0 out of 5 stars,Muttley

We have gone through 2 monitors so far and this one, is our 3rd.  In comparison, this monitor far surpasses the others we have owned.  Pros: 1) It's compact which I like a lot.  You don't have to carry a clunky object around the house. 2) The screen doesn't come on unless you want it to!  You can black out the screen but still hear your little one.  3) The picture quality is great.  With the others we have owned, if it was just getting dark outside, the screen would be black and fuzzy and you couldn't see anything.  4) This monitor doesn't have a physical/tangible antenna so there are no worries about breaking it off.,The only con I have found with the monitor is that you can't move the camera remotely.

If you want to wall mount the camera (we take down a picture and mount it on the existing nail, very easy) the camera won't rotate enough to see the room -- it's still mostly pointed down. We remedied this by folding up a plastic back and tucking it between the base and the wall. It added just enough height to raise the camera to see the room. Do wish there was a better wall-mounting option.

"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","SHORT SUMMARY,===============,The X-T30 is, in my opinion, the best all-purpose camera under $1000 right now. The X-T30’s still image quality, video quality, ease of use, and good portability all add up to a winning combination. The only major negative about this camera is the lack of in-body image stabilization (IBIS), which is a sacrifice needed for both cost and weight savings. Arguably the Sony A6400, which is the closest direct competitor, has slightly better autofocus and a more versatile front-facing flip screen, but if you like some of the Fuji-distinctive professional features like manual control dials, film simulation modes, and clean output of 10-bit 4:2:2 over HDMI, you can stop looking right now and just buy the X-T30.,Is the X-T30 good enough to tempt you from your current system of lenses to the Fuji ecosystem? I made this exact decision almost two years ago. Getting the X-T20 in late 2017 and using it for a few months led me to sell my 2 Canon bodies, 2 flashes, and 6 lenses because I realized Canon would never give me un-cropped 4K video at a great price. Now, the X-T30 is a vastly superior camera to my beloved X-T20, so you might be next into the Fuji fold!,BACKGROUND,===============,I owned the X-T20 for a year before trading up to the X-T3, so this X-T30 is my third Fuji and I’ll use it as a second body for me and as a shared camera for my 14-year-old (I need a B cam for video and he needs a smaller camera to fit his hands, so we'll both use it at different times). All these purchases give me insight into a big chunk of the Fuji lineup, so I’ll compare it to both the X-T20 and the X-T3 so that current Fuji owners or prospective  Fuji owners can know where this new model sits in the ecosystem. I still use Canon bodies and the Panasonic GH5 extensively at work for video, so I’ll compare it to those systems as well.,FEATURES I LOVE,==================,Here are the major standouts of the X-T30 that make it exceptional for the sub-$1000 price bracket:,▶ 4K VIDEO with oversampling instead of binning or skipping, something that’s computationally difficult to do on a larger sensor like the 26MP APS-C found here; the X-T30 has the same quad-core processor as its bigger brother, the X-T3, so it can easily handle video tasks. The fast processor also makes the overall interface feel snappy and consistently quick (no lag).,▶ The X-T30 yields beautiful, low-noise 26-MP STILL IMAGES from the X-Trans APS-C sensor.  APS-C is quite a bit bigger than the Micro 4/3 sensors in this size and price range. This is the same sensor size as the entire X-mount lineup, and some sites claim that the detailed studio low-light noise tests show slightly worse on this model than its 24-MP predecessors, but in the real world I have found that the performance is superb. When paired with one of Fuji’s well-built X-mount lenses, the still images will hold up well to any DSLR under 30MP (and the video looks as good as any 4K camera PERIOD, matching units costing 3x-5x as much!). Check out the various demos online of the video quality, especially if you can download the original file and not rely on overly-compressed uploads like the ones you'll see here or on a video sharing site.,▶ Convenient HANDLING and extreme PORTABILITY: you can buy this camera and a Fuji pancake lens for portability that rivals a large smartphone (albeit too thick for most pockets), but with manual controls readily available at your fingertips that bring back the joy of photography. This carries over well from the X-T20 that I owned before and that brought back the fun I had lost after owning a succession of five different Canon DSLRs during the previous 12 years. The most obvious change is that the X-T30 eliminates the discrete selector buttons on the back in favor of a 4-way joystick, and in general I think this is an upgrade. The much-discussed Q-button placement that's now directly under your right thumb takes some getting used to, but you may end up buying one of the grips or hand straps that allows you to fully customize the ergonomics, so this is always a very subjective discussion anyway. Ultimately I prefer the X-T3 with a battery grip because my hands are pretty big, but the X-T30 feels plenty secure when I use a hand strap to attach it to my right wrist.,▶ Super fast, accurate, predictive AUTOFOCUSING in stills and videos (even beating the X-T3 until the T3 gets an update). I'm not a sports photographer, but I do have kids that dart around, so the X-T30 is a big improvement over the X-T20 and I'm eagerly awaiting the new firmware for the X-T3.,▶ Absurdly fast CONTINUOUS STILL SHOOTING, up to 30 FPS or 20 FPS with no crop; the buffer will fill up ridiculously fast, but it’s nice to know this is available, especially if you have a fast SD card that can drain the image buffer quickly. The image buffer is on the small side; don't plan on using the 20 FPS mode for more than a second!,▶ Unrivaled PORTS and HDMI OUTPUT for a camera of this size: thankfully Fuji has embraced USB-C for charging, and the X-T30 adds the ability to use USB-C headphones as well so that you can have a microphone (via 2.5mm adapter) and monitor the playback on the USB-C port. Usually, this combo is only found on much bigger/pricier cameras and it makes the X-T30 a serious contender for a real video production camera (as long as you can work around the 10-min limit for 4K recording to the card). You can bypass the time limit via HDMI where you can output clean 4:2:2 10-bit footage (with or without the subdued color F-log setting) that makes this camera on par with professional Hollywood rigs for post-processing and color tweaking. Most of the time you'll want clips shorter than 10 minutes anyway! By pro standards, a $900 body is disposable, so to get this level of color science and bitrate at this price would have been unthinkable even 3 years ago, especially for internal recording on an SD card. The Panasonic GH5 really changed the landscape when it launched 2 years ago, and the X-T3/X-T30 have continued that trend at even lower price points (with larger sensors that do better still images).,FEATURES THAT I DISLIKE OR ARE JUST MISSING,========================================,▶ Where is the flippy screen!?!? The size and weight of this camera would be perfect for blogging, but you can’t see yourself because the screen only tilts and never flips up to face the front. Canon and Panasonic have this figured out and maybe they have strong patents or another way to scare off poor Fuji. The autofocus on the X-T30 is great at holding your face, fortunately, but it’s still unnerving to not see anything when the camera is pointed toward you. My cheap workaround is to use my phone (strapped to a Gorillapod leg) as a Wi-Fi live view, but there's a small delay and it's hard to tell focus accuracy.,▶ Only one card slot. I’m being picky because no other camera in the segment has two cards, but I dearly love that feature of the X-T3.,▶ 2.5mm mic jack. Why, oh why? I get that this non-standard small mic port doubles as a remote release, but Fuji please just throw an IR port shutter release on the front and call it a day. Every video person has to buy an adapter to get good sound from their external mic! Maybe include a nice adapter in the box?,▶ No battery grip option. Even my old/cheap Rebel cameras had support for a battery grip, and this X-T30 is even smaller than those, so big hands may be really frustrated with the X-T30. Fortunately, my unit is always on a Gorillapod for stills or on a gimbal or tripod for video, so it’s not a big deal for me. It's a great size for my 14-year-old.,▶ Battery life is barely adequate for Fuji-brand batteries and terrible for other brands. Especially for video, you have to buy the fancy, expensive Fuji batteries because the knock-offs don’t hold up. The “S” on the 126S battery denotes some sort of better heat dissipation for 4K video, but none of the aftermarket makers have gotten the message on how to do this. Fuji even gives you a dire message when you’re using a knock-off, so consider yourself warned.,X-T30 VS . . . .,==============,Vs. the Fuji X-T20 (previous model),▶ A small upgrade compared to my trusty little X-T20. If you only shoot STILLS, you'll enjoy the new autofocus joystick and enhanced algorithm, but it's probably not worth the money for only 2 extra megapixels. The image quality isn't that much better and may actually be slightly worse in extreme low-light conditions (pixel peeping in the lab/studio).,▶ For VIDEO, the new autofocus on the X-T30 makes a bigger difference. Video autofocus is actually fully usable now. Also in the video realm, the image quality at 4K is oversampled thanks to the quad-core processor, so you should notice a difference in fine details and noise because the X-T20 used line skipping to get 4K from the entire sensor width.,▶ Headphone monitoring via a USB-C adapter. If you're using the X-T30 for video, you can now monitor the audio levels with headphones directly in the camera and check that your external microphone is working well.,Vs. the Fuji X-T3 (bigger brother/sister),▶ The X-T30 is very comparable in terms of image quality and video quality, so the additional $500 for the X-T3 is all about ERGONOMICS, size, and usability. The biggest exception is 4K at 60 FPS; if you need that, buy the X-T3.,▶ They've reserved pro-level features, like the battery grip option, PC (studio flash) port, and larger viewfinder for people MAKING A LIVING from their daily camera use.,▶ If you've got bigger hands, need more ports, want the best video rates (60 fps and 400 Mbps internally), prefer the larger viewfinder, or generally need the best Fuji has to offer in the small sensor space, get the X-T3.,▶ If you need the smaller ergonomics and want to spend the $500 difference on a NICE LENS, you won't sacrifice that much by choosing the X-T30.,▶ There's not nearly as much difference between the T30 and the T3 as there was between the T20 and the T2. It's a great day to be shopping for a sub-$1000 Fujifilm camera!,Vs. the Sony A6400,▶ The Sony A6400 has the same sensor size and is priced head-to-head with the Fujifilm X-T30. The choice will come down more to your preference for which manufacturer and system of lenses you want to commit to than the actual camera body. Sony, thankfully, now has a wide array of bodies in this size and price range, which was their differentiator until they disrupted the full-frame scene with their mirrorless strategy.,▶ I had this exact choice, Sony vs. Fuji, when I went to Fuji two years ago. I actually sold a Sony Handycam and Canon EOS DSLR (and a bunch of lenses) to buy into the Fuji X-mount system of bodies and lenses. I chose Fuji because:,▶ Sony's menu system on the mirrorless cameras confuses me. I've used Canon and Nikon extensively in the past and now use Fuji and Panasonic regularly, but Sony seemed to be way worse in my eyes. This is subjective, but it's a constant thing I didn't want to deal with. Ergonomics count, especially when you get used to Fuji's excellent dial system--wow!,▶ Fuji has made an all-in commitment to APS-C, the sensor size that's smaller than 35mm full-frame but also quite a bit larger than micro-4/3 (MFT). I went with the APS-C sensor size when I purchased my first Canon digital Rebel in 2005 and I was pleased with Sigma's lens choices (some meant for APS-C, some for full frame). I didn't feel stymied at all enjoying the good balance between weight and grip size. Sigma does have many lenses for Sony, but Sony's native APS-C lenses have a lot of feature and focal-length gaps. Fuji just doesn't make a bad lens in the XF space, and there aren't really any major gaps, which is a good thing since there aren't many (any?) autofocus third-party lenses for the X-mount. Pro-tip--Sigma can convert existing lens mounts for a price, so you may be able to pay for permanent conversion or buy an adapter if you end up going from Canon to Sony or Nikon to Sony and want to bring your non-Sony lenses. That wasn't an option for me, so I sold everything and bought Fuji gear.,▶ At the time, I was giving up Sony's better AF tracking, which has improved even further in this latest A6400 (borrowed mostly from more expensive Sony full-frame models). Fortunately, the X-T30 also has upgraded AF, so I think the Sony and Fuji options are now fairly equal, especially since you can get nice, fast Fuji XF prime lenses in either f/1.4 or f/2.0 flavors. The f/2.0 series especially won't break the bank and are super lightweight, well-made and SMALL.,▶ I am seriously wishing the X-T30 had the Sony's front-flippable screen for vlogging. Canon, Panasonic, and Sony have all figured out ways to do this. What's holding back Fuji?? The A6400 has a flip-up screen, but it's a little hard to use if you mount a shotgun microphone on top of the camera. You'll need a little bracket from Smallrig that moves the cold shoe mount over to the right side, thus exposing the screen to front viewers.,Vs. Micro 4/3 (MFT),Wow, I'm categorizing a ton of great camera from Olympus, Panasonic, etc. into this one bucket. But, if you're really starting out fresh with your next choice of a camera body (and locking yourself into a system of lenses), use this as a jumping off point for your research.,▶ For STILL images, the X-T30's larger sensor and higher pixel count will produce much cleaner, lower-noise images. It's as much better than MFT as the full-frame cameras (like the Nikon D850 that's over three grand) are better than the X-T30. The difference is that the X-T30 costs about the same, or often significantly less than, the MFT equivalents. The weird part is that even without third-party lenses, the native Fuji lenses are often similarly priced or cheaper than the MFT lens for an equal focal length. I very nearly purchased a G-series Panasonic MFT camera before going with Fuji, and lens selection was very heavy in my decision.,▶ For VIDEO, Panasonic is really hard to beat. Their GH5 / GH5S duo is just stunning. With in-body stabilization in the GH5 and a 4K-centric chip in the GH5S, these rugged little guys are amazing. I use the GH5 at work (and the GH3 and GH4 before that) and it's so cool to have pro-level features in a small, cheap body. I really love the auto-focus pull automation and the excellent stabilization on the GH5, both of which are best-in-class. Ultimately I chose the Fuji series because of the still image quality, and now with this latest generation in the X-T30 and X-T3 that support high-bitrate internal recording and F-log, I'm not really giving up much in the video space (other than IBIS). I wish Fuji would have waveforms built in, but for the extra cost of a GH5 over the X-T30, I can buy an Atomos 5"" screen that has all that, or upgrade to the recording version and record 10-bit 4:2:2 over HDMI with HLG. Wow, that's a lot of technobabble, but the price/value ratio of the X-T30 gives you a TON of options for lenses and other pro-level accessories that you would still need to purchase with the GH5.,Vs. Canon and Nikon,Neither big C nor N are willing to be serious about the mirrorless APS-C sensor size, especially when it comes to video features and native lenses.,▶ Canon's M series is OK for stills but still a joke for video quality and pro-features. You do get their excellent dual-pixel autofocus, but Fuji has mostly caught up in that arena and surpassed Canon in everything else related to video features.,▶ I can't even say that I miss the beautiful flash system that I enjoyed with Canon because the cheap-o Godox TTL flashes I bought for Fuji seem to produce the same results that I got with my expensive EX600 speedlites, at 1/4 the price.,▶ The only saving grace for C & N in APS-C is the availability of Sigma lenses, like the excellent Sigma 18-35 f/1.8 that I owned for a few years. I would have abandoned Canon's APS-C system and gone full-frame long ago (or just to a cell phone) if it hadn't been for these Sigma DC HSM lenses that filled-in critical gaps. I'm very glad that Canon is making such amazing full-frame lenses for their new R body (and Nikon for Z), but it still doesn't help when you want a small body with a 6-oz f/2 lens like my X-T30 and 35mm f/2.0. You have to invest $1100 in a new iPhone to get anywhere near this ratio of quality to portability, and the X-T30 is available at launch with this 35mm lens for just $999.,I've attached 8 photos of the X-T30 by itself, and next to my X-T3. I hope you enjoyed reading this review! Please check out my profile and see the other reviews I've written as well.","March 26, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Steve M.
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","I'm really happy with this camera. I upgraded from the Fujifilm X-A5. It's very lightweight, which is what I was looking for. I can't stand when a camera is super heavy. This one is the perfect weight. I can tell already it will be great for traveling.","March 27, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,emily gale
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","I sold all of my Canon gear recently and went with this great Fujifilm camera. With the kit lens, it focuses with incredible speed and accuracy. The stabilization on the lens is great for video work as well. There are so many things that are great about this camera but I can't list them all.,One of my favorite capabilities of this camera is the ability to use vintage manual focus lenses. With the focus peaking feature you are able to confidently nail your focus. This feature has really brought back the fun in photography for me and exploring the wealth of affordable lenses.,If you have larger hands I would suggest an external grip, I went with the Meike MK-XT20G and it fits perfectly.,I was not sure if I should go with the X-T3 or the X-T30 and other than the larger grip area I have not been left wanting any of the features on the X-T3 so far.","May 20, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jonathan L.
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","The ""Fuji X T30"" This is my 2nd Fuji product, have many Nikon's, and Sony's.,I like this medium sized body, easy to carry around,If you compare body to body with Sony medium body camera they are very close in features, but the kit lens that comes with Sony is not Zeiss, its sold by Sony, not sure who makes it. The Fuji kit lens 18-55 is an outstanding lens, this does make the package more expensive, but worth it - I think!,I have also always liked the colors that Fuji seems to be able to produce, In my opinion, superior to Sony.,A wise man once said the ""The best camera is the one you have with you"".,Now a days there are many cameras in this class that are all excellent, so far I like this one.","May 10, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dave
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","Great for the casual shooter or as a backup / broll camera! I purchased this camera to compliment my Fuji X-T3.  It's definitely small in the hands and doesn't have all the dials of the X-T3, BUT the image quality is just as good!! Probably one of the best compact cameras in the market for the price.","May 1, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Eric Guajardo
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","Sold my Canon Rebel T3i and Canon lenses and bought the Fuji X-T30.,Image quality:  no complaints! Focus accuracy, dynamic range, sharpness, low light performance, and noise reduction are all noticeably better.,Body and handling: I’m happy with the size and build quality, and I think it’s a good compromise between size and handling for my mediumish hands and preference to travel light.  It’s nice to have a body and lenses that fit the sensor size and I find that I bring the camera along for family outings, travel, etc more than I did before. The lenses are perfectly suited to the system, and are pleasantly clicky and smooth. They are small, metal, and lovely.  I was surprised though—I do miss DSLR controls on the camera body.  All reviews indicated that the dials made for an engaging experience, but I find that I actually need to disengage the camera to tweak the settings, whereas a DSLR allows you to modify settings with one hand without pulling your eye from the viewfinder. The Q button is a bit of a pain—-I often accidentally bring up the Q menu. The menu/ok button is also a pain—-I sometimes mean to bring up the menu but click ok. The joystick is great.,Autofocus: great, but not perfect. It’s faster than I’m used to, the full frame coverage is impressive, and it works in relatively dim light. It is not 100% intuitive and has a bit of a learning curve, however. And while it is faster than what I’ve used before, it remains a hair slower than my kids.","June 12, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,L
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","My first ""real"" camera in a while. The image quality in both photos and videos is excellent and the camera is easy to handle. No rolling shutter in video, which makes a world of difference from other cameras in this price range and means you can actually shoot really beautiful video with it.,Overall I really love this camera, especially in combination with some of the nice prime lenses available for it. There's room for improvement, but I wouldn't want to trade it for anything else with the same form factor.,Instead of rehashing other reviews for this camera, I'll focus on a things I found noteworthy that I didn't find mentioned anywhere else, and only learned about from using the camera.,• No JPEG+RAW in Auto mode.,The camera can shoot in JPEG+RAW mode, which is my preferred choice. I will use the JPEGs to transfer to my iPhone wirelessly to quickly share a photo but keep the RAWs around for archival purposes. The Auto mode is a must-have feature to let anyone unfamiliar with the camera successfully take a picture with the camera. Sadly, you can't capture in JPEG+RAW in Auto mode. This is probably where you'll need RAW the most, because white balance and exposure will just be the camera's best guesses, and not what you chose carefully when shooting pictures yourself.,• Autofocus noise through built-in mic.,If you stick with the 18-55mm kit lens you won't have this problem because it has a very quiet focus mechanism. I bought the 23mm 1:1.4R and 35mm 1:1.4R lenses, and both have fairly loud autofocus mechanisms. Even when you use these lenses with manual focus, you're actually not controlling the assembly directly, it still uses the motors to focus. With either of these lenses, the internal mic is unusable because it will pic up constant focus whirring, which has ruined quite a few videos for me. The ST-1 external mic still pics up autofocus noise but less loudly, so you'll have to be creative and isolate the mic from the body physically and move it further away from the lens than the included mount does.,• Mobile app is poor.,The ability to wirelessly transfer photos from the camera to my smartphone was a key feature for me. It works most of the time, but the remote app is fairly poor. It's hard to understand and can take several tries and jumping through hoops to make it connect properly to the camera. The multi-select interface is finicky; if you don't have perfect aim for the checkmark, you are taken to a detail view with just the one photo, this is slow and when you go back, it is scrolled back to the top. After selecting a few photos and hitting transfer, sometimes it will tell you there is not enough room on your phone for the photos, and you need to start over. It doesn't tell you how many images it would have room for, so you just have to guess. Finally, remote capture is problematic. When you enable the live view, the connection with the camera prioritizes keeping the viewfinder up to date over taking a picture, so the shutter lag between photos is much longer than when taking pictures directly. This is pretty crappy when you're trying to take a group shot with yourself in it using your mobile phone, which is exactly the kind of situation where you'd want to rapidly take a lot of pictures to increase the odds of getting one where everyone's eyes are open at the same time.,The WiFi connection sometimes stutters, and it would be nice if the camera would let me pick what wifi channel to use, or if it could join my home WiFi network instead of having to do a ad hoc network between the camera and my iPhone, at least for remote shots taken at home.,• Microphone jack and USB-C port interfere with each other,If you use an external mic for video (you should) you'll have to disconnect it every time you connect the camera to USB-C. The connectors are spaced just slightly too close to each other to both be plugged into the camera at once. It would be sweet if they add a mic connector to the hot shoe for their own mic, so users don't need to have the camera door permanently open, deal with dangly cables, and the eventual inevitable failure of the minijack port plugging the cable in and out a lot.,• Q button,Okay, this one you will find in other reviews, but it's worth echoing here. It is very easy to accidentally hit the Q menu button. Not a problem for me, the primary operator of the camera, because I can slowly learn not to put my thumb there. The real problem here is that 9 out of 10 times when I hand the camera – in Auto mode – to someone else to take a picture, they will hit the Q menu and will get confused. There's now a firmware update that lets you remap this button and makes it slower to respond, so this should be somewhat improved.","June 22, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,Dirk Stoop
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","As a dedicated Fuji user I was curious about the improved autofocus vs. the past generations.  Believe the hype.  Set up the camera yesterday.  Slapped on my favorite XF lens - the 35 1.4.  Super snappy performance with the rendering that this particular lens is known for.,Took a short walk today with the 100-400 lens.  After a little cursing and disappointment at the tracking - the focus box was all over the place I realized that it was user error.,I had touch screen autofocus enabled and my nose was moving the box around.  Doh! 😂,Turned off the touchscreen AF and a tern flew by.  Boom!  Nailed it.  A duck flying by very quickly skimming the water over Lake Washington.  All 5 images were sharp.,I’m impressed.  The Charcoal Silver is very attractive and the AF is excellent.  Haven’t tried the Eye Recognition yet but that isn’t a top priority for me.,I miss the D pad but it isn’t a dealbreaker.  Having a hotshoe mounted thumb rest is a must on all the small XTs and helps to avoid the issues some are reporting with inadvertent Q button activation.,Worthwhile upgrade in my opinion.","June 29, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,jc
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","I own the A7iii as my ""big"" camera. It's so great but its heavy and large. The X-T30 is tiny! I purchased it with the 23mm F1.4. Makes for the perfect go to camera for daily carry. My Sony will always go on vacation with me but this little Fuji will go everywhere else. Having the same sensor/processor as the X-T3 is killer in a body this small. Fuji color/style comes through so well. I would recommend a grip as the body is a little awkward to hold due to its small proportions. Build in flash isn't the best but having it on the body at all times is so helpful in a pinch. ""Auto"" mode is pretty much terrible but you don't buy a Fuji for auto mode. Fuji lenses are cheaper than Sony's and are easily just as good. Make for a perfect Camera! Highly Recommend to anyone wanting Tiny and Mighty!","June 25, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jonah Willis
"Fujifilm X-T30 Mirrorless Digital Camera, Black (Body Only)","After being hard set for so long on getting a Sony a6300/6400, I came across the X-T30 and decided to go for it based on how similar it was to the Sony specs-wise, as well as the Fuji having better professional reviews and a better kit lens (Sony's kits lenses are generally considered sub-par).,Also, Fuji having such a long history of great cameras..not to mention the great classic look of the X series, did me in.,I mostly got it for landscape and city/street photography, but also have hopes of doing astrophotography eventually with some 3rd party prime lenses (Fuji's primes are a bit out of my budget currently). Besides the lower price, I also selected it over it's big brother, the X-T3, because of its more compact size and lighter weight. But besides those things and a few minor feature limits, it is essentially the same camera for a few hundred $ less.,I will update soon with more thoughts and some photos..","June 23, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bizzlllllle

"AbergBest 21 Mega Pixels 2.7"" LCD Rechargeable HD Digital Camera,Video camera Digital Students cameras,Indoor Outdoor for Adult/Seniors/Kids (Black)","I purchased this camera for my 10 year old daughter to take on her first class trip to Washington DC this past weekend. When the camera arrived last week, we charged the batteries, purchased a SanDisk SD card to store images on, and got a padded case to go with it. After batteries were charged we tested the camera and took several pictures to make sure the camera was working, and to make sure our daughter knew how to operate all the functions on it.  Nothing seemed amiss, our daughter was thrilled, and she was all set to go.,Upon her return this evening, we found out that the camera began glitching. The screen would freeze after taking pictures, every few photos. The second day she used the camera it froze and became unresponsive. Her teacher turned the camera off and on to see if it would unfreeze, and my daughter reported that half of her photos on the SD card had disappeared.  When my daughter took more pictures and tried to review them, there was an error message saying ""no such file exists"".  She then turned the camera off and back on again, and the device erased ALL the pictures on the SD card.,We have tried to connect the camera to our computer, and it will not allow itself to be recognized by our computer.  We hooked the SD card up to a separate card reader with USB port, and the SD card is functioning just fine.  Just empty.,This camera is a worthless piece of junk, and my child is now absolutely HEARTBROKEN because NONE of the pictures she took on trip were recorded, and she has NO pictures from her first trip to our nation's capital.  The reviews all said this camera was great for kids and as a starter camera.  I do agree with it's basic shape - the size of the camera body was just right for her, the functions were simple and easy to figure out, and the extra battery was a nice bonus.  But there must be some major flaw in the internal components for it to completely erase a brand new SD card.,Do not purchase this camera if you are wanting your child or family member to have a reliable device to take pictures of anything memorable.

Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"The Fujifilm X-T3 is a fantastic camera, I’m so glad I upgraded.,First a little background. I’m a hobbyist photographer who has been doing hobbyist photography for about 25 years since I was in my teens. My first interaction with cameras was my father’s Asahi Pentax 35mm film camera which he bought in England back in the 60s. By the time I started to use that camera, it was older than I was!,In my early 20s, I decided to step up the game and bought a Panasonic fixed lens “SLR look” camera. That was 1” sensor if I’m not mistaken. I took some pretty decent photos with that digital handheld camera.,Back in 2013, I told myself that I’d upgrade once more and take a stab at the DSLRs. So I invested in a Canon Rebel T3i which came with the kit lens, 18-55mm. I also added a 70-300mm telephoto zoom lens to my arsenal and used this setup for 5 years. I’d shoot anything from my kids at home, to dance concerts to archery events and really maximized the Canon in many ways. I started to shoot in P-mode for about one year and then mostly shoot in Aperture Priority Mode, with some shoots done in Manual Mode. The T3i was a great starter camera.,In 2017, I decided that I wanted to upgrade my camera and this is where things got confused. I looked at full frame cameras in Canon, full frame mirrorless in Sony, Micro 4/3, and APS-C cameras in almost every manufacturer, except Nikon (reason being, if I was upgrading in to a APS-C DSLR, I told myself I’d stick with the Canon). Believe me when I say that I had researched cameras for more than 18 months before deciding to invest in the X-T3. I then narrowed down my search to mirrorless systems. A friend of mines let me use his Olympus OMD-M5 for a few hours. Two things that struck me… How light the mirrorless was compared to my Canon and the ability to see what the photo looks like in the EVF or on the LCD with different ISO, Shutter Speeds and Aperture settings. Looking for the mirrorless, the search then spread to Sony (both full frame and APS-C), micro 4/3 in Panasonic and Olympus and of course Fujifilm.,I eventually ruled out Sony. I felt that the “starter” Full Frames from Sony lacked some of the better features that the other, similarly priced APS-C cameras possessed. Plus, I thought the Sony lenses were too expensive. Micro 4/3 systems were inveigling me but that small sensor capabilities in low light, even with fast lenses was a bit iffy (for me).,Eventually, in early 2018, I settled on either the X-T20 or the X-T2. The first feature that I was drawn to was the retro styling… the full manual adjustments on shutter speed, ISO and exposure. And the manual aperture ring adjustments on equipped lenses. Drool!!!! I was taken back to my teens when I was shooting on my dad’s Pentax and how excited I was to see how my photos would come out when I played around with different settings, not to mention the disappointment I would feel when I saw many over exposed or under exposed photos. For me, shooting on the Canon did not give that experience and while I learnt to navigate the buttons quite well for shooting in Aperture Priority or even Manual, the Pentax experience was always top notch.,The Fujinon lenses also appealed to me. All reviews I read alluded to how sharp images were. And the prices of the lenses, while quite steep, were still cheaper than some of its counterparts in other manufacturers.,I think in early 2018, I eventually settled on the X-T20 as it had many of the features of the X-T2 with the touchscreen. Then came July 2018 and I saw that the price on the X-T2 dropped to $1,099 a mere $200 more than the X-T20. The X-T2 then became the camera of choice. In early September, my decisions were stymied by the launch of the X-H1 as I began to wonder whether Fujifilm were heading in a different direction for IBIS. But I told myself that the lenses would be around for a while and that the X-T2 would be the way to go. Mid-September I was about to buy the X-T2 and while looking at a review of a Fujinon lens on dpreview, I saw a post on the new X-T3. I read all I could about the X-T3 and saw that there were introductory offers available on the X-T3 and many of the Fujinon lenses. Eventually I bought the X-T3 along with the Fujinon XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR Lens.,I got the new setup over two days ago. Configured the camera to the way I want it, including back button focus and some customization on the Fn buttons.,This camera is a dream to use. The build quality of the camera is first class and solid. My setup with the 16-55mm lens and the camera is a bit heavy, but that’s a price to pay for quality glass. The camera does indeed feel like the old Pentax and after shooting about 50 pictures, it is so effortless to simply turn a dial or a ring to adjust some aspect of the exposure. No more fiddling with this dial and that button and looking at a LCD screen to see the exposure settings before taking a picture, or half pressing the shutter button to see the same information in the view finder (that’s what I had to do with the Canon).,The X-T3 is heavily customizable. Every setting is easily changed from the intuitive menu. One small complaint is that some of the menu settings are not that self-explanatory or clear so you would need the manual to decipher what a change in that setting does. Maybe in a firmware update Fujifilm could add a little on screen explanation on menu settings so the user can understand the change being made without having to revert to the manual.,Which brings me to firmware. My camera was shipped with revision 1.0 of the firmware. I downloaded the latest firmware from Fuji’s website and followed the instructions to upgrade on the camera. The actual upgrade takes less than 90 seconds. So I would suggest that once you get your camera, perform the firmware update before doing anything else.,The EVF is crystal clear, and to be honest, there’s no difference to me in using this EVF as compared to the pentaprism on the Canon. I found that the transition was seamless. The LCD is fun to use although I have found that sometimes my nose would cause a change of setting, especially a change in AF. So I just disable touchscreen AF.,I tried a 120fps slow motion video capture of my daughter jumping. This is an awesome feature that I know I’ll love at those archery shoots. While the camera touts some impressive video features, only with time will I be able to unlock that potential. And speaking of archery, the 20 fps and 30 fps burst shooting would be great once I put it to the test. I did a few frames at these speeds and the camera was quite fast so this is another feature that I’m excited to use on the archery range.,The AF is spot on fast. What I love about how I have the camera configured is that with back button autofocus I can leave the AF in Manual mode but still have AF-S or AF-C by either touching or holding the AF-L button (which I have configured as “AF-ON”).,I have attached some photos to the review. All but the two photos of the X-T3 alongside the Asahi Pentax were out of camera JPEGs. The X-T3 alongside the Asahi Pentax were taken with my phone to give you an idea of the retro styling and the retro look with the silver and black. The photos show you the background blur you can get – that’s the lens mind you. But Image Quality looks great for out of camera JPEGs. The amount of detail is amazing with this camera and lens. Look at the photo of the lemon and all the imperfections you see on the skin! The picture of the willow was intentionally underexposed as I tried to show just how bad the weather was. And that chicken was on the grill while I was taking the photos. It was about 75% done but still looks delicious. You will see that there is a picture of some ants on an orchid leaf. Well for that picture, I was using AF-C mode. It was a challenge to get a fast moving ant in the focus point but once I did and locked on, the camera kept focus on the ant to the top for a few frames, until it disappeared or I moved.,I’ve only had this camera for a few days but already love the combination of the lens and the camera. I can tell that this would be a great investment. After 18+ months of research and dawdling, I am glad that I took the time to research my options and bite the bullet with this X-T3.","October 9, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,A.M.
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","I have only had it for 6 days and, as a lifelong Canon shooter, am still on the learning curve, but so far, I love what this camera can do. Perhaps the biggest surprise so far, is that my Canon glass with the MC11 adapter performs better with the Sony. Case in point is my Canon 70-200 F2.8. On my 7D, this lens only got sharp at around f4.5 in spite of tweaking the focus. With the Sony, the darn thing is now sharp at f2.8 - that's huge for me as I was getting ready to sell this lens and upgrade to the Tamron when they offer their native Sony glass.,Aside from lens performance, high ISO shots are simply amazing - even at 12,800, they are better than 1600 on my 7D - changes everything for me based on what and how I shoot. Though getting used to controls and functions will take a while, I love the customization that is possible and have already tweaked it with the controls I think I will need. Tons of videos out there on how to set it up - take the time to watch a few and it will save you tons of time. Also, don't forget to set up a control button to turn on the APS-C crop, instantly provides 50% more reach at the expense of about 30% reduction in resolution but it beats post processing cropping.,After 8 days in Sedona and the Grand Canyon, I am even more impressed. I exposed almost every shot for the highlights trusting I would be able to bring out the shadows with no noise, I was not disappointed. I have attached an example where the shadows looked black in the viewfinder.","April 23, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,DVAB
Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I'm a professional commercial photographer, and when I initially bought into the Fuji system it was for personal use. I wanted a compact mirrorless system that I could take with me and not feel like I was working. Over the years as the cameras improved they started becoming my working cameras simply because I enjoy working with them. I now use my Fujis for most event work because I could easily carry 2 cameras and get the same image quality of my full-frame Nikons for this type of work without all of the heavy gear. With the X-T3, Fuji has addressed a shortcoming of the previous versions of the X-T line in that it now has a full axis digital level. I'm showing a house I shot yesterday with the 10-24mm on a brand new X-T3 (Shot in jpg since RAW functionality isn't available in Adobe Camera RAW as of this writing). The new digital level functionality allows me to quickly shoot something like this handheld. As a bonus, it started raining while shooting this and I didn't have to sweat it since the body is weather sealed. Otherwise, if you're an X-T2 or X-H1 shooter, the new features aren't going to dramatically improve the image quality over those models. If you're coming from an X-T1 or similar generation of Fuji cameras (X-E1/2, X-Pro1, etc), or if you shoot video, then this camera will be a very worthwhile upgrade.","September 24, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Joseph Nienstedt
Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Two years ago I switched from Canon to Fuji and haven’t looked back. Even after a brief fling with the Sony a7RIII when it came out last year, I discovered I still preferred shooting with Fuji.  So when the Fuji X-T3 was announced earlier this year, I knew I had to get it.,Now that I’ve had the chance to shoot both stills and videos with the Fuji X-T3, I feel like I can give it a proper review.,This review will be a little different than other ones out there. Rather than a nerdy, super deep-dive into the technical specifications of the camera, instead I’m going to seek to answer one question -- a question I’ve gotten DMed quite a lot on Instagram:,Is the X-T3 worth the upgrade?,Hopefully this review helps you with your decision.,Improvements over the Fuji X-T2,I was perfectly happy with my Fuji X-T2, but of course, my friend Wayne had to ruin my contentment by reminding me that the grass is greener on the other side.,He messaged me on Facebook one day and seduced me with words like “back-illuminated X-Trans CMOS IV sensor” and “quad-core X Processor 4.”,I didn’t even know what the hell those things meant, but I knew I had to have them.,As it turns out, the new sensor and processor are responsible for most of the camera’s improvements. Here are some of the key features that convinced me to upgrade to the X-T3:,•More megapixels,•Better low-light performance,•Faster autofocus,•Drastically improved eye-autofocus,•Smarter battery grip function,•Fantastic video quality,Let’s dig into these improvements and how they’ve impacted my real-world shooting.,*More Megapixels*,The Fuji X-T3 offers 26 megapixels compared to the X-T2’s 24. For me, it’s practically impossible to tell the difference at a normal crop, but those extra megapixels come in handy if you ever need to heavily crop in post.,*Better Low-light Performance*,So what exactly does a back-illuminated sensor mean for your pictures?,Simply put, it lets the camera gather more light which improves noise performance. While the Fuji X-T2 had a base ISO of 200, the Fuji X-T3’s base ISO is 160. Not a drastic change, but an improvement nonetheless.,*Faster Autofocus*,Some of the lenses that Fuji makes aren’t the snappiest with autofocus. (I’m looking at you, 56mm and 23mm f/1.4!),But put those lenses on the X-T3 and the difference is quite noticeable. Overall, I’ve noticed less hunting and sluggishness when shooting with those lenses, especially wide open.,Even better, focus accuracy has improved even when my subject is backlit -- a hugely welcome improvement.,*Drastically Improved Eye-AF*,Perhaps one of the most impressive improvements of the Fuji X-T3 is the eye-autofocus.,Admittedly, this very feature is why I flirted with the Sony a7RIII last year. While the Fuji X-T2 had almost everything I wanted, its eye-AF wasn’t impressive at all. Sony was the first to offer fast and accurate eye-autofocus.,You might be wondering: What’s so special about eye-autofocus?,This feature comes especially in handy when shooting moving subjects. As a portrait and fashion photographer, I’m always asking my subjects to go through a range of motions while I attempt to capture the perfect frame.,Before the X-T3, attempting to keep your subject’s eyes in focus as they move can be difficult. In single-shot mode (AF-S), you have to constantly move the joystick to place the focus point where you want it. In continuous mode (AF-C), sometimes the subject’s eyes wouldn’t be tack sharp.,But the Fuji X-T3’s eye-AF is game-changing. My keeper rate when shooting in this mode is significantly higher. In my opinion, the Fuji X-T3’s eye AF is every bit as good as the Sony a7RIII’s.,*Smarter Battery Grip Function*,I have very little qualms about the Fuji X-T2, but the battery grip for it was a major point of frustration.,When using the battery grip, there were countless times that the camera would shut off when recording videos.,I discovered this is because the battery grip doesn’t automatically “hot swap” batteries when shooting video. So if one of the batteries in the grip dies halfway through a video, that’s the end of your video. This limitation makes the X-T2’s grip completely useless for video purposes.,The Fuji X-T3 grip resolves this issue by automatically switching to the fresh battery, preventing any abrupt cutoffs.,Note: The X-T3 does not require the grip to take advantage of faster shooting speeds like the X-T2 did. The grip only serves to give you more shooting time.,*Fantastic Video Quality*,As if the X-T3 wasn’t already impressive enough, Fuji decided to make it a competitive video camera as well.,Before you scoff and say to yourself, “This section doesn’t apply to me, I’m not a videographer,” hear me out.,Video content is more important than ever. Social media platforms are prioritizing video content over stills and text. I’ve even noticed that more of my client inquiries lately have asked about video. So even if you haven’t incorporated video into your work, it’s something well worth considering.,Along with the ability to shoot 120fps slow-mo at 1080p and 60fps at 4k, the X-T3 also offers the ability to shoot F-log internally, meaning you’re no longer required to connect your camera to an external recorder if you want to shoot flat footage to color grade later.,Of course, if you don’t want to bother with color grading, you can instead choose to any of the built-in film simulations to your videos, including the new Eterna profile which offers beautiful cinematic tones.,So is the X-T3 worth the upgrade?,Absolutely yes.,If you’re coming from the Fuji X-T2, you’ll notice a difference in both performance and quality.,If you’re coming from any X-series camera before the X-T2, you’ll notice a HUGE difference in performance and quality.,Perhaps the better question to ask is “Who might NOT want to upgrade to the X-T3?”,If you shoot still subjects and are not at all interested in video, you probably won’t benefit much from upgrading to the Fuji X-T3.,But even then, at a price point of $1,499 (which is $100 lower than the Fuji X-T2 when it was first released), the X-T3 is an outstanding value no matter what you shoot.,Thanks for reading, and happy shooting!,Kevin Titus Photo,@kevintitusphoto on IG","November 6, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kevin Kleitches
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Best camera on the market right now. Ive been shooting sony since the 1st gen a7 series, going from an a7<a7s<a7ii<a7rii & now the a7iii. Between the first 2 generations there were limitations that i felt yearning for such as longer battery life, dual card slots & better autofocusing in challenging light etc. The a7rii did so much for me & was way ahead of its time but those departments i mentioned were still lacking & i had hopes of them being filled when gen 3 would be released. When the a9 and a7riii released i was excited to know that they implemented those changes but my pockets weren't deep enough to budget for either of those 2. I stayed more focus on the rumors & hopes of an a7iii announcement not nearly expecting as much as what was to come. Sony hit it out of the park and released a camera that blows all the competition away, somewhat cannibalizing their higher end sales, this camera fills in every space i ever wanted in a camera.  Granted theres some things that could be done differently, such as better touch implementation & making both sd slots UHS-2, however those may be wants for others but i have no gripe with either of them. For the large majority of people this camera can do it all at a much more (still high) affordable price point. Unless you have the need for 42mp or 20fps than this is the sony camera to get. It has placed my a7rii as my backup camera & am using the a7iii even over it for landscapes and portraits because the color rendition & joy to use has been improved. I can ramble on all day about all the tech features etc, but if you are looking at this camera & on the fence about it, you will not be disappointed.,Pros:,-amazing autofocus that covers almost entire frame,-large battery,-improved color over previous gen,-amazing lowlight performance, better than a9 & a7riii, about as good or better than a7sii in certain modes,-improved ergonomics,-improved menu,-touchscreen focusing,Cons:,-touchscreen limitations, can only be used for focusing,-only one uhs-2 slot,I have attached some images i have recently taken with the camera as well.","April 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Zachariah Morales
Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Firstly some background: I've been a big fan of Fujifilm gear for decades. Have owned (and still own) several of their X-series of cameras. I do a lot of indoor family/pets photography and travel photography.,Secondly, there are so many great and comprehensive reviews about the X-T3, that it feels futile to try to do the same. So, instead, I'm going to give you my impressions after nearly a month since purchase.,Things I really like about this camera:, * Articulating touch screen, * Electronic viewfinder, * Autofocus speed, * Autofocus settings, * Customizability, * Ruggedness, * Weather sealing, * Quality of nobs and buttons, * Image sharpness,Things that need work:, * Menu settings are still super unintuitive, * App sync and connection,Things that I'm disappointed about:, * Noise. I could rant about this for days. In essence, it performs horribly at ISOs above 400 (yes, even at something mild like 640 it begins to show some chroma noise). I have compared it with same lens, same subject, same light, same ISO, same aperture and shutter speed using an old X-E2, which is about 5 years old, and in most situations the E2 simply produced a much noise-cleaner picture. I know, the fans will surely cry 'don't pixel peep, just enjoy the camera' but that argument simply doesn't hold any water. You see, unlike other aspects of picture quality noise is pernicious and pervasive. If affects *everything* and there is no amount of Lightroom you can throw at it, if the noise it gets out of the raw file is high. I can hear fans also saying 'you probably got a bad copy' funny you should say that, because after a colleague got his, we swamped bodies and saw the same thing. Simply put, for a camera which was built in 2018 and costs $1500 it exhibits an unacceptable amount of noise., * Front side button placement: I don't care how delicate your fingers are and how dexterous your are. You *will* unintentionally press one of the three buttons/nobs Fuji placed in the front of the camera. I had to remove any functionality that was attached to them. It can literally stop you on your tracks while shooting something important. If you do get this camera, first thing you should do is re-program the front facing buttons to do nothing.","December 21, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Relentless
Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"I decided to commit to one ecosystem, and I dropped Sony. Yes, I dropped the FF A7III for a crop sensor. Right now I firmly believe that crop is the best blend of size (especially lens sizes), quality and price.,With the new processor all the battery grip does is give you extended battery life, there is no performance boost. With that said, I kinda wished Fuji changed the camera grip and gave us a larger battery. But since I have a bunch of batteries, i guess it doesn't bother me.,The features of this camera is amazing, it takes the best of the Sony A9 with blackout free shooting at 30fps, Eye AF that's close to Sony's science, pro mode of the Olympus E-M1 where it captures when you half press the shutter and dumps the buffer as you go so you can get the shot you want which is great for sports/action, weather sealing is even better... Plus I love the dials, if that's not your thing, you can assign those to the dials and custom buttons on the body too.,Unless Fuji changes for the worse, they won a permanent fan and I don't care that it's a crop sensor!","September 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Vinh
Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,"Being an owner of multi generations of Fuji Cameras... including the latest models, the X-T3 moves the bar to a new high level. The image quality is equal or better than the Fuji X H-1; the perfomance in lower light situations is very good; the value is stellar.  Couple all this with the consitent build quality and Fuji's commitment to keeping their products fresh through regular firware updates and you have a winner.  This time it is the X-T3. IQ with Fuji's quality lenses, yield some of the best images I have seen since starting my move from 30 years with Nikon.","October 4, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dr Nash
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Before getting into the details, I'll just get the summary out of the way: This camera is fantastic. It is replacing my aging Canon 5D Mark III, and it does that job well. The biggest benefit for me is the in-body stabilization (SteadyShot), which works perfectly for legacy and other non-stabilized lenses. Sony calls this a ""basic"" model, but it is far beyond what I would consider to be basic.,Now, on to some of the negatives:,The menu system is an improvement, in much the same way that a coyote attack is an improvement over a grizzly bear attack. It takes a while to slog through the menus and set the function and custom settings to make sure you never have to open the menu again.,One thing I love about Fuji cameras is the plentiful dials and knobs set to one—and only one—setting. The a7III has two dials that change according to the mode. Living between Aperture and Manual, the switches take some getting used to. This issue is not unique to the a7III, just something I wish was addressed.,Since I am primarily a Canon shooter, and Sony lenses are about as affordable as a kidney on the black market, I adapted my Canon lenses to the a7III. While non-stabilized lenses uses SteadyShot by default, my stabilized Canon L lenses prevent me from using SteadyShot, even when optical stabilization on the lens is turned off. While I understand that I'm complaining about a minor use case related to Canon lenses on a Sony camera, I shoot often in dark environements and cannot always bring a tripod.,Try as I may, I cannot think of any other reasons not to buy this camera without getting into detailed technical specs. The biggest issue I've had with Sony cameras up to this point was the star eater debacle, which does not seem to be impacting the a7III. If you've got $2k buried in the couch cushions and need an entry level professional camera, you can't go wrong with the a7III.","April 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kirill Makarenko
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","As a former Canon user, I have no regrets moving to the Sony A7iii.  None!  This camera is the best in its price range, bar none.  It has nearly perfect autofocus, doesn't hunt in lowlight, and I have no issues with the color science (unlike some complaints in the photography community).,The bottom line is, if you are a photographer and workflow is essential to you, this camera is going to speed. it. up.  I spend less time in post color-correcting images, I have many more keeps because it nails the autofocus (unlike Canon where even if it should have focused correctly, it didn't), and it is ergonomically pleasing if you have small-to-medium size hands.,Cons:,-It doesn't come with a dedicated battery charger.  Sony, this is stupid! You'll have to buy one.  They are cheap.,-It is much harder to find equipment for it at the last minute.  If you need something, you need to know well before you need to use it.  Like flash, for example.  Don't expect to walk into your neighborhood camera store (yes, I still have one of those) and just grab accessories made for Sony.  Most likely you'll be relegated to buying them online, or asking the shop to order them for you (unless you live in NYC).,-If you use the adapter mounts, expect less stellar results, but still good results.

Fujifilm X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) - Silver,I coming from someone that had a D3400 so really any upgrade is going to be of significance for me. That being said I just love to travel and taking pics as a hobby. My first choice was going to be the Sony A7iii but since that was on back order at the time and wanted something better for my last trip I went with the XT3 and ended up loving it. I don't make any prints and really just post to social media so this camera is more than enough by any means for someone like myself.. in addition the video is awesome as well.

"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Love the a7iii! I use it together with my Xt2... IMO the focus and low light performance is way better than XT2. Definitely will be using the a7iii at night!  IQ is also amazing on the a7III but, I don't think I would say its way better than the Fuji.  Battery life is insane on this camera. One battery is all I need 99% of the time on the a7iii. On the XT2 I will normally use 2-3 batteries when I go shooting. The film simulations and the 56 1.2 on the fuji (Haha fuji shooters will know) are pluses on the fuji.  The fuji is also a smaller camera but the a7iii has a better feel when holding it.,The a7iii is definitely overall a better camera, but I am comfortable with the way I shoot with the XT2(I know the camera in and out. I know its strengths and weaknesses. I  know how to work around them) I plan on using both cameras. The XT2 paired with the 23 1.4, 35 1.4, and 56 1.2 for portraits/street photography and The Sony with 16 - 35 GM and 70-200GM for everything else :)","May 28, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Daniel Jozwik
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","I was looking to upgrade to the Full Frame family, but didn’t know if I wanted to stick with Canon or to move into the Mirrorless side with Sony. At the time I was looking, all the hype came out about the new Sony A7iii that I just had to research into it more. I read multiple reviews between the A7R and this one, but due to my love for low light photography and shooting at night I leaned more towards the A7iii. Remember, I am moved from the crop sensor to a full frame- the price made it an easy choice to go with Sony compared to Canon, but note that when you start to buy lenses it will get pricey until 3rd party co. catch up to their comparable lens. I’m just a novice loving the exploration, and having a Mirrorless camera to see the shot before I take it definitely helps.  The picture I included has little editing done on Adobe Lightroom, and this was taken after the sun just set with dark skies.  (Long Exposure). I would definitely recommend the Sony 24-105mm G OSS Lens as an all purpose if you invest in just one for now.  Hope this helps!","July 27, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrence
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","Truly impressive.  Everyone knows the stats.  The color science has been slightly improved, but I would still put Sony slightly behind Canon and Fuji. Ergos are ok, menu system isn’t THAT bad, but isn’t good either.,Bottom line is nobody else is delivering this kind of value at this price point.,Everyone else is playing catch up in the full frame mirrorless market, and probably will be for quiet some time.","June 3, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pablo S.
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)",I did extensive research into this purchase and have been very satisfied with my choice. I was unable to hand hold almost any shot because of my hands shaking. I am able to do hand held shots again! I have been able to get decent shots hand holding down to 1/8 of a second.  I had all Canon gear and when I decided to make the change to mirrorless I knew it would be expensive.  I chose to get the Sony 24-105 F4 G lens to go with the body and use it almost exclusively. I also purchased the Metabones V adapter and have had no trouble using my Canon lenses with the Sony body. I think I even get better results from the Canon lenses than I did on my Canon camera. I will admit that the menus are daunting and there is a big learning curve but I am slowly working my way through the process.  I haven't tried any video yet so I can't speak to that.,"November 28, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightstalker2011
"Sony a7 III Full-Frame Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Camera Optical with 3-Inch LCD, Black (ILCE7M3/B)","This camera is a seismic shift for stills shooters that want to go mirrorless. An affordable full-frame stills camera that can mount basically any lens on the marketplace, take incredible raw shots that are usable well past ISO 6400. And an incredible 4K video camera. The a7 III is a game changer, and I'm excited to see Sony continuing to disrupt the camera market and kick Canon and Nikon in their complacent keisters.,The previous a7 series cameras had a lousy battery that would die in just a few hours. a9, a7r III and a7 III have fixed that with a new battery design that can make it through the day. Honestly, at $2000, you need to be a VERY successful professional photographer to need any more camera than this.","July 26, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,M. M. Rizzo

Although I knew it was a ""bundle,"" I didn't expect the products I discovered. Honestly, I thought most of them would be throw-aways, cheap, and not worth my time. But the bundle was only $4 more than the camera alone, so - what the heck?,First - the camera. It is exactly what I was looking for. Great optical zoom, 20 mp resolution, which allows plenty of image to play around with software-wise. Light, easy to handle, intuitive. I could go on, but suffice it to say that, for a point and shoot camera, this Canon takes awesome pictures. My first outing with it was a trip to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. My pictures could be hung in a gallery, they are SO good.,Second - the bundle. The case alone was impressive. It is one that I would have picked for myself. In addition to being roomy enough for all my stuff - camera, tripod (mini), charger, cleaning cloth, extra battery, it is well-built and looks as if it will stand up to years of use. The tripod is exactly the same one I had on my Amazon wish list - but I got lucky. It was included in the bundle. Cleaning supplies - check; excellent quality charger (with car adapter!), extra battery, extra 64 gb memory card, and some other things I don't recall right off hand.,I'm still astounded that all of these goodies were included in a bundle that cost me less than $5 more than the camera alone.

Good for someone who doesn’t want the hassle of bringing a big camera and all the interchangeable lens when vacationing.,Cons-  The picture quality is not as good as a DSLR camera, it is not suggested for professional use.  You cannot change out the lenses.  If you want a DSLR camera than but it. I would not suggest that you buy this camera expecting it to be equal to a DSLR camera.,Overall-  I purchased this camera for traveling cause I did not want to lug a heavy camera and all its accessories when traveling.

"Canon PowerShot SX420 IS Digital Camera (Black) with 20MP, 42x Optical Zoom, 720p HD Video & Built-In Wi-Fi + 64GB Card + Reader + Grip + Spare Battery and Charger + Tripod + Complete Accessory Bundle","I just wanna start off saying this is a really great beginner camera. This is my first “professional” camera that I have ever owned, but I think it’s safe to say I’m not so much of a “beginner.” I’ve done photography before but I’ve never had my own camera, so I thought this would be a good one to start with. I got it recently and I still have the option to return it and I’ve really been considering it. I personally like having a little more weight in my hands when it comes to my cameras, but that’s just a me thing. I think the camera settings are cool so to speak - they’re more filters to play with than be serious with, but that’s just my own opinion. The continuous shot feature on the camera has to be the one I really hate. It’s basically the same as the normal shot - it takes a really long time to buffer and honestly that takes away the whole point of a continuous shot. I also don’t like how I’ll see the shot I wanna take in the viewfinder, but the moment the picture is actually taken, it looks different. This is especially apparent when taking certain creative liberties with your lighting. Also, the camera does not work well with motion in my experience. Either it’s too late or too early, again this goes back to the continuous shot problem. Also I was told there is a photo editing program that comes with the camera, but I have yet to discover it. I do want to say this, if you have never done photography before then this is a great camera to get you started. I just have a bit more experience so it’s nkt really doing it for me. The zoom, though, is amazing. I was in my backyard and I zoomed into my neighbors tree that was on the other said of the neighborhood, and the camera captured the leaf perfectly. It was amazing. Who knows, I might give the camera another try, but I don’t know. This camera honestly isn’t bad and is worth the investment if you’re starting out or just like to take pictures. It gets the job done.","July 19, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Cha Cha

Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I'm a long-time Nikon user, going back to film camera days. I've eagerly awaited Nikon's first full-frame mirrorless cameras, and the new Z6 exceeds my expectations.,First, this is truly a Nikon. Build quality if outstanding, and the look and feel is 100% Nikon. If you've used a Nikon DSLR, you'l be right at home here. First and foremost, picture quality is just outstanding. Detailed images, with natural colors, especially skin tones. I've always thought Nikon's colors were a standout, and the Z6 continues in this tradition.,There's tons of options for shooting different effects, and the Z6 expands to include many additional filter effects I've not seen on prior high-end DSLRs (you can find these under the ""Set Picture Control"" option, most easily reached by pressing the ""i"" button on the back. The touch-screen is a great feature here, it makes navigation from the ""i"" button quite natural and easy. I didn't notice any banding or moire effects in various outdoor shots at smaller apertures (shooting both the 24-70 Z lens and a number of my older AF-S lense via the excellent FTZ adapter). Hi-ISO performance is stunning. Even at 12,600, there's amazingly little noise in the Z6 images. In sum, the Z6 produces excellent images in either Raw or out-of-camera JPEGs.,Highlights with the Z6 controls and usage are the huge, bright no-lag electronic viewfinder. This is a joy to use! Even in very-dark scenes, the viewfinder shows a bright, clear image, almost like night vision for very dark night scenes. There is truly no discernable lag here, either.,Nikon *finally* added U1-U2-U3 settings to the program dial, a much better system than the ""shooting banks"" from prior high-end offerings. This allows you to setup 3 different camera states (I use ""landscape"", ""portrait"", and ""action"") and recall each with a simple turn of the dial. So much easier than the old method.,Many early reviews (especially of the Z7) raised some issues with autofocus, especially in tracking modes of faster-moving subjects. I've just not had issues in this area in a few days of usage of the Z6. The single point modes are great, and cover nearly the entire image area. There's a ""nub"" controller on the back, perfectly placed under my right thumb, that allows you to move this point easily over your subject. The Z6 was tack-sharp in nearly every photo using this method, especially with the native 24-70 Z lens. The auto modes worked well, too. It's not quite as quick to pickup less-contrasty subject in AF-C modes compared to my D500, but it's pretty close. There is 3D subject-tracking mode under ""auto"". Press the center OK button, and a white box appears. Move this over your subject (by either re-framing or the nub control), and half-press the shutter. The Z6 will now track this subject throughout the frame. Give a full shutter press when you want to take the shot. The framing box will continue to track the subject, so you can keep taking shots as you like. Work's great. The Z6 uses a combination of shape and color info to recognize the subject, and follows it throughout the frame. To reset the box, you have to hit ""ok"" again, and you can start again. Easier to use than describe here, actually.,There's just so much more to say about the Z6. I haven't dived into video modes, but all the other reviews say this is an extremely capable video camera. In-body vibration reduction (called IBIS - in body image stabilization) is another game changer on older lenses that lack this feature. Focus peaking (courtesy of the electronic view finder) means use of older, manual focus lenses is quite easy! Between IBIS and focus peaking, those older Nikon telephotos are starting to look like a real bargain.,Mirrorless really is a game changer, and Nikon's first full-frame versions are an outstanding advance. So many features here: in-body stabilization, autofocus covering nearly the entire frame, an outstanding, high-res and no-lag viewfinder, tons of picture and shooting options, it all adds up to a highly recommended camera in a great, compact form.,I'm not selling my D810 or D500 just yet, but the Z6 has become my go-to camera for most usage (I'm still shooting wildlife on the D500). Well done, Nikon!","November 22, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,J. C. M.
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I shoot the northern lights weekly and sometimes nightly for 8 months a year. I purchased this after reading reviews and seeing test images at high ISO level with the expectation that the noise / grainly levels would be better by about 1 stop over the Nikon D610 which I'm coming from. From my experience, this is true and the image quality is fantastic. This is a great camera for low light, astro/ northern lights work based on the output. The low light video is sensitive enough to film the northern lights in real time and the digital viewfinder helps you set the correct exposure the first time when the lights are bright. When they are very dim the view finger doesn't seem to pick them up at all.,Here are some of the negatives that I expected going in and I have taken no stars off for:,-Less than stellar battery life,-XQD card slot (I had to pay 120 dollars for my card, my sd cards are 20-30 dollars normally),-needs an adapter for f mount lens,-3rd party batteries don't work (yet perhaps some will be engineered in the future),Here are the problems that I have had that I did not expect starting with the most annoying and it really distracts from the user experience massively:,- Every time I put it on a 2-second timer delay and the camera times out to sleep mode it wakes up out of it, and every time I shut off the camera in 2-second timer delay mode it turns on out of it! Mind you I exclusively shoot on a tripod on a 2-second timer delay for night shots to give the camera/tripod 2 seconds to settle down after touching it and have no handshake. Every time I have to hit the button and reset it and this is a pain at -20  to -40f in Fairbanks, Alaska in the winter when I don't want my fingers to freeze! My Nikon D610 has a dial for timer delay on the top left and never changes unless I tell it to! This alone is worth minus 2 stars for me, I am considering returning the camera or selling it over this issue. I guess I could get a remote shutter release instead... but this brings me to the next issue.,(If somehow there is a way to have the timer delay stay permanently activated let me know in the comments and I'll add back on 1-2 stars despite the other issues) If this is not the case, Nikon do a firmware update and fix this, for God's sake!,-My 3rd party speed flash won't work on it, it feels like Nikon specifically engineered its new camera to not allow the user to use 3rd party accessories and force you to buy a several hundred dollar flash over my perfectly fine 30 dollar fash. Does this mean if I buy a 3rd party remote shutter release it also won't work to solve the lack of a permanent 2-second timer delay mode? My workaround has been to hand hold the flash (so I don't cause camera shake when triggering it) and manually trigger it. This is not ideal and freezes my fingers further in the sub-arctic of Alaska. I use the flash for aurora portraits.,-Every time the camera goes to sleep or is shut off the aperture rings stop down to the smallest aperture. I shoot wide open or almost wide open on all my shots so when I turn it back on the aperture blades open up again, will this cause excessive wear and tear on the aperture blades and motor and break my lenses? I do not know but it worries me. I wish the blades stayed in sleep mode exactly where they were when it went to sleep / was shut off at.,-Lightroom will not detect any of my lenses for the lens profile correction (I am only using the adapter). This includes sigma, rokinon, and tamron. I have not tested to see if Lightroom will detect my lenses shot on a Nikon brand lens through the adapter yet. This isn't that big of a deal but all the annoying things add up to a frustrating user experience.,-For extreme low light situations, the digital viewfinder is a negative. You can use the optical one on the Nikon D610 to compose a shot with almost zero light by using subtle silhouettes and shadows but with the Z6 you get all black if its dark enough. This means you have to take a few test shots and adjust your camera to the right composition based on them, this further chews up the already weak battery performance and takes up more time which causes fingers to freeze more in the cold.","December 14, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Aaron
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"These are my first impressions with the Nikon Z6.  I will update this review as I learn more:,I loved shooting the Fuji X100 series for it's light weight and simple UI.  But The ultimate shooting experience has always been with my Nikons.  When we got focus peaking and meaningful fps with the D850 I was happy, sold the X100T, and have been happily gripping my D850 wherever I go with the lightweight 35mm 1.8 and a 70-200 f4.  I toss in the 20mm 1.8G and 300mm PF when I travel and keep the 60mm and 105mm macros handy, as needed.  Been shooting Nikon since the D1, then D70, D200, D600, and now the current generation (as of Nov 2018).,(I will need to test the new diffraction compensation mode (leaving off for now), and how this might interact with the AA filter, vs the D850),Onto the camera:,The Z6 takes great pictures.  I attached two ISO 25600 (insane!) pics to this review, edited in camera to jpeg normal.  Pics of the kids look even better and I'm looking forward to attaching this to my telescope and 20mm for nightscapes.  Nikon image quality.  2 Thumbs, all the way up.,Handling: Left hand is fine.  Play and delete buttons are top back left.  Mode dial requires a push of the center button to turn.  Nothing to see here, folks.  It's fine.,Right hand: It's OK.  New layout, which is ok.  AF-On and joystick nub are where they should be.  As is D-pad - as accustomed as I am  to the DSLRs I found these three important controls well placed. The challenge was with the 4 lowest buttons.  As it is now, I find myself looking at those (menu, shooting mode, + and -).  If I wasn't programmed for my DSLRs I am sure this wouldn't be an issue - there is no perfect layout for everyone and the camera makers do their best.  It's different from my D850, as it should be.  I'd have tried to do things a little differently but Nikon didn't ask me.  :)  Otherwise, I like the grip.  I wear small or medium size adult male gloves, and my hand fits perfectly over the grip and finding the AF-On button with my thumb is comfortable.,I usually utilize the depth of preview button on my DSLRs.  Doing so here seems pointless/useless so I will make that button do something else.  For now I have it set to change focusing modes, as it is quicker than using the i menu.  Second front button is set to ""My Menu"" which works for me.,Ergonomics: I usually use a Fusion Photo Gear plate with a Herringbone Hand Grip and Black Rapid sling straps.  The plates and hand grip don' fit or feel right, which has sent me on a wild goose chase. For now I have a plate on that is compatible.  Will update this once I find a proper solution.  The problem is the FTZ adapter gets in the way of all the various plates I have in inventory.  Something functional will come along, but in the meantime I am hacking things together.  Since it's so light, I added a leather wrist strap to the grip side for when the strap isn't needed but I want to keep the camera secure to my body.,Usage: I'll use the FTZ but I won't like it.  It works. But it feels weird and adds odd length.  My 70-200 f4 chirps and creaks something odd while in continuous AF mode, hunting within a certain zone.  75% seem to be in focus, at ISO 21500.  The 70-300 AF-P seems to move similarly, albeit much more quietly.  Same hit rate.  But it was dark when  I tested.,Will keep an eye on this because the d850 nails these lenses in the dark.  Will have to test with some nightscapes and parties.,Menus are familiar.  If anyone knows how to make the ISO move in 1 stop increments, please lmk.  I either keep glossing over it, or it isn't there.  :/,The usable AF points over the whole frame: genius.  Finally.  Well done, Nikon.,Weight and Carrying: Love the light weight of the Z6 with the 35mm S lens.  This is why I could leave the Fuji X100 - the kit is larger but not obnoxious and the lens and image quality will keep me coming back for more.  For travel, I'm happy with this combo.  With the 70-200or300, even more so.  Will be nice to have native lenses at some point, though.,4 stars until the lenses come, and we all learn more about the Autofocus system.  I appreciate what the FTZ adapter is supposed to accomplish but I just don't like it in af-c with the 70-200 f4.  I had big hopes here, and maybe I have to better understand the focus system.  Hopefully this gets sorted out via firmware updates, if not in a re-education of how to use the AF system.  Chasing kids, pets, birds, and such is so easy with the 3D tracking on DSLRs that it became my default AF mode.  Yes, I am spoiled, but it really is that fast and useful.  That said, there's nothing really wrong with the Z6 autofocus system.  I believe it works as it was designed, and we can auto-track just as the manual describes.  It's the extra step it takes to get there.  If 4.5 stars were an option, then that's what I would rate it.","November 23, 2018",4.0 out of 5 stars,undfined
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I was hoping for this to weigh less than a typical SLR. I have a Nikon D300s and needed something that shot the same quality but lighter. Sadly, this wasn’t it. It isn’t worth the money to have something pretty much the same weight but negligible in terms of quality of phots, for what I do with them at the least. I’m going to wait till technology gets better and these things go lighter.","December 22, 2018",2.0 out of 5 stars,Franwin Pharmacy Mineola Surgical
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"Autofocus is terrible.,Reviewing images I can see the red box was placed on the subject and still it recorded the image out of focus. I went to a Nikon event and had the Nikon representative check the settings and aimed it at him. Most of the images were still out of focus. After a few tries he told me that their photographers do not use face detection and just shoot single point. We tried that and it was better, but at 1 to 1, the focus was still off. If you have a patient subject you can get your shot. The idea of upgrading is to get something better than what you had. Lets be honest, any experienced photographer has a pretty good idea how the image will look with a light meter. EVF will not dramatically change your results. Having a good autofocus will dramatically change you results. Equate it to a Ferrari with bald and brittle tires. If your careful and go slow you can keep it on the road. You could have kept a Ford Pinto on the road and also bought a house to drive home to. I admit the Ferrari is beautiful and that is what you get here.,Colors and noise are rendered beautifully, but that was also the case with the D750. If you think a splash of water will not kill a D750, you are mistaken. If this camera has the same sealing it means lens release button has no gasket so...,I was truly disappointed. I wanted to love this camera, maybe that is why I was so disappointed when it would not let me.","January 12, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,ioji
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I went from D5000, D600, Fujifilm X100S, X70 to Nikon Z6. Mainly using ultra wide and wide primes. Nikon is clearly on to something though the Z6 design and performance leaves something to be desired for me. Needs a firmware update to fix continuous AF.,Pros:,-Lightweight body,-5-axis IBIS,-Excellent video recording capabilities,-Ergonomics, controls and Fn customization (can set Fn1 to Playback for one handed reviewing),-Responsive touch screen,-3 User modes (though these keep resetting when powering back on so you lose any adjustments made in that mode. You have to save after each adjustment),-USB-C,Cons:,-Play button is on the left (fixed by using an Fn button),-No flip-around screen for selfies or vlogging, like the EOS R (deal breaker for me),-Viewfinder lags when shooting fast,-Prefer a more compact mirrorless FX model without a viewfinder,-No built-in flash (for those emergency fill in shots),-Continuous Autofocus tracking sometimes loses the subject. Seems to work better in video mode than photo,-XQD card is currently pricey. Only 1 slot,-Lack of pro lenses at the moment (f1.4 primes and f4 zooms are nice but we really want f2.8 zooms)","January 7, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,DJ
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,My first hobbyist camera was the Nikon FE. Since then I have jumped in on only the historic improvements. This is THE latest. I love  the feel of the camera and the quality of the pictures. It is sort of old school in that it’s full frame digital but in the more classic understated body size of the FM and FE. So easy to use that I hardly need the manual. It is is amazing even with my “ old” lenses.,"November 21, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,uncas
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I'm a beginner photography enthusiast, and was wanting to get my first full frame camera, and boy, I feel like I hit the market at both a great time, but almost overwhelming time with the choices. A few months earlier and my only FF mirrorless choice would have been the Sony, but with the Nikon out, I researched the two extensively. I've seen a lot of of the photography community recommending Sony, but for my purposes, I thought the Nikon was a better fit, and in the past month of using it, I've never regretted going with the Z6. Regarding the camera's auto-focus performance, I've never had issue, but from what I understand, the criticism has centered around fast moving subjects such as wildlife or sports photography, which isn't my game. I am exploring astro, landscape, and street photography, plus just getting some great shots of the family, and it's been on point. Regarding battery life, I'm generally shooting for maybe 2-3 hours at a time and been fine, but did run out of juice on Thanksgiving when I was using it all day and had to take a break to charge it, so I'll prob get an extra battery at some point (baby steps).,Ultimately, I chose this over the A7iii as it seemed like it would be easier to learn for someone newer, and overall, it checked all the right boxes in terms of ease of use, viewfinder, durability/weather-proofing, ergonomics, and picture quality, and I've been enjoying getting myself out of auto mode and exploring the artistic opportunities this camera affords me. I would like to see eye auto-focus come down the road as its available in the A7's and EOSR, but aside from that, I think it's just an awesome tool that you can't go wrong with. Btw, I give two shits about dual slots, but I'm just a hobbyist and not shooting weddings or anything, so is a non-issue for me, but totally get that criticism in its reviews by pros.","December 20, 2018",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tony R
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I currently shoot several Nikon bodies so my expectations were high. ( D850, D500, D750)  I actually really love this camera . I bought it for video and I have found myself shooting it for everything. No it does not track like the d500 ! However I have found that single shot focus is the very best mode for even a flying bird. I know that is  not the preferred method but it actually works . Being a long time DSLR shooter I was surprised at how much I have enjoyed the EVF . The images are tack sharp and the ISO performance is outstanding. The Video, well its phenomenal!!  Loving this little camera !!","January 10, 2019",5.0 out of 5 stars,Robert J Smith
Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"Pitched as a replacement for the D750; have one, no it's not. Focusing is way, way better than Fuji but not at D750 levels. IQ is really good, just like the D750. But white balance flips out often. Battery like stinks but that's mirrorless for ya.,Great camera, adapter lets my dozen Nikkor lenses work perfectly. Firmware updates (I hope) will fix the problems in time.,Size is FANTASTIC!!!","February 5, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,S. W.
