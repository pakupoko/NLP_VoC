"December 20, 2018",Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"Regarding the camera's auto-focus performance, I've never had issue, but from what I understand, the criticism has centered around fast moving subjects such as wildlife or bursts photography, which isn't my game.",5.0,Tony R
"December 20, 2018",Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"Regarding battery life, I'm generally shooting for maybe 2-3 hours at a time and been fine, but did run out of juice on Thanksgiving when I was using it all day and had to take a break to charge it, so I'll prob get an extra battery at some point (baby steps).,Ultimately, I chose this over the A7iii as it seemed like it would be easier to learn for someone newer, and overall, it checked all the right boxes in terms of ease of use, viewfinder, durability/weather-proofing, ergonomics, and picture quality, and I've been enjoying getting myself out of auto mode and exploring the artistic opportunities this camera affords me.",5.0,Tony R
"December 20, 2018",Nikon Z6 Full Frame Mirrorless Camera Body,"I would like to see eye auto-focus come down the road as its available in the A7's and EOSR, but aside from that, I think it's just an awesome tool that you can't go wrong with.",5.0,Tony R
